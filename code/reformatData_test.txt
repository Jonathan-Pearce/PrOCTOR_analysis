Frequent nocturnal awakening is a common behavioral symptom       of AD. Nighttime wandering and agitated behavior may result in injuries and sleep disruption       for caregivers. Alternatives are sorely needed to the currently available sleep medications       that have marginal efficacy and serious side effects. Melatonin is a naturally occurring       hormone secreted by the pineal gland. It has soporific effects with oral administration and       is well tolerated. It enhances sleep in normal older people. Melatonin also may help sleep       disturbances associated with AD; however, this remains to be proven.|In Alzheimer's disease , sleep disruption is one of the most common behavioral problems,       occurring in 45 percent of patients. These nocturnal awakenings and agitation lead to       considerable burden for caregivers and frequently lead families to the decision of nursing       home placement. The proposed study is a randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo       controlled, clinical trial. Placebo will be compared with two doses of melatonin: a 2.5 mg,       slow- release preparation and a 10 mg immediate release preparation. One hundred and fifty       community-residing AD patients with disrupted sleep will be recruited. Included subjects       will meet NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. Prior to study entry, disrupted sleep will       be documented by clinical history and by 1 to 2 weeks of recording using wrist activity       monitors. The treatment period will last 8 weeks. Rest/activity patterns will be recorded by       wrist activity monitors. The primary outcome measure will be the change in nocturnal sleep       time from baseline to the end of the treatment phase.        Other outcomes also will be examined, including the time awake after sleep onset, sleep       latency, sleep efficiency, daytime agitation, and changes in cognition. The relative       effectiveness of high and low dose melatonin will be assessed. Adverse events and side       effects will be compared by treatment. This study should provide the data necessary to       determine whether melatonin is a safe and effective treatment for disrupted sleep associated       with AD.|Completed||||||Phase 3|Interventional|Allocation: Randomized, Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment, Masking: Double-Blind, Primary Purpose: Treatment|||||||Inclusion Criteria:            -  Patients must meet NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Results from previous clinical trials suggest that galantamine may       improve cognitive performance in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. It is not a cure for       Alzheimer's disease. Nerve cells in the brain responsible for memory and cognitive function       communicate using a chemical called acetylcholine. Research has shown that deterioration of       cells that produce acetylcholine in the brain affects thought processes. Galantamine is       thought to work in two ways to increase the amount of acetylcholine available in the brain.       It inhibits an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine and it also stimulates the nicotinic       receptors in the brain to release more acetylcholine.|After a 1-month single-blind run in phase, 910 subjects will be titrated, over a period of       up to 8 weeks, to target doses of either: 0 (placebo); 24 mg/day galantamine; 16 mg/day       galantamine; or 8 mg/day galantamine, in a 2:2:2:1 randomization ratio. Double-blind       treatment will continue for a total of 5 months. The change from baseline in ADAS-cog and       CIVIC-plus scores at Month 5 will be the primary efficacy endpoints. Tolerability will be       evaluated based on adverse event reports, laboratory values, ECG, and vital signs with       particular focus on the adverse event rates in the slower titration schedule for 24 mg/day.       Efficacy of 24 mg/day and 16 mg/day galantamine will be compared with that of placebo.       Information on the dose response relationship of galantamine will be evaluated.|Completed||||||Phase 3|Interventional|Allocation: Randomized, Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment, Masking: Double-Blind, Primary Purpose: Treatment|||||||Inclusion Criteria:            -  Probable Alzheimer's disease            -  Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 10-22 and ADAS greater than or equal to 18            -  Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive portion (ADAS-cog-11) score of at              least 18            -  Opportunity for Activities of Daily Living            -  Caregiver            -  Subjects who live with or have regular daily visits from a responsible caregiver              (visit frequency: preferably daily but at least 5 days/week).

In women, most       estrogen is produced by the ovaries. Men produce estrogen by converting testosterone into       estrogen. Because this hormone also has many beneficial effects on brain cells, it currently       is being studied as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The enzyme that forms the       neurotransmitter acetylcholine is promoted in the presence of estrogen. Several very small       clinical studies have demonstrated improvement in cognitive function and mood measures in       women with Alzheimer's disease who take estrogen.||Completed|October 1995|January 1999|Actual|January 1999|Actual|Phase 3|Interventional|Allocation: Randomized, Masking: Double-Blind, Primary Purpose: Treatment||||120|||Inclusion Criteria:            -  Women with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease who currently are not taking estrogen              replacement therapy, who have had a hysterectomy, and who are in stable general              health.

The purpose of this study is to determine the       effects of different doses of buprenorphine/naloxone in treating opioid dependent       individuals who were previously maintained on methadone.|Buprenorphine is a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid that is being developed as a treatment       for opioid dependence. Because buprenorphine is a partial mu agonist opioid, under certain       conditions it is possible for buprenorphine to precipitate opioid withdrawal in opioid       dependent individuals. A person with a high level of physical dependence could experience       buprenorphine-related precipitated withdrawal.
