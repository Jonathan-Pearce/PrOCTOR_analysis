patients who show benefit without severe side effects may continue       for additional cycles. treatment for the first cycle will be administered in the hospital.       if the drugs are well tolerated, additional therapy may be given on an outpatient basis.        a biopsy (removal of a small sample of tumor tissue) will be done at the beginning of the       study, after completing the first treatment cycle, and possibly again when the cancer slows,       stops or gets worse, or if the patient leaves the study. these tumor samples will be       examined to evaluate the effects of treatment. several blood samples also will be collected       during the course of treatment to monitor immune system effects. a device called a heparin       lock may be put in place to avoid multiple needle sticks.|background:        renal cell cancer responds to treatment with a variety of antiangiogenic and       immunomodulatory drugs.        in the renca model of renal cell cancer the combination of il-12 and pulse il-2 cures       88-100% of mice with established tumors.        the tumor regression observed in this model is due to both antiangiogenic and immunologic       effects.        objective:        to define the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities of recombinant human il-12       administered intravenously in combination with intermittent pulse recombinant human il-2 in       adults with various advanced and/or refractory solid tumors.        to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intravenous rhil-12/pulse rhil-2 administration in       adults with various advanced and/or refractory solid tumors.        to provide a preliminary assessment of the ability of rhil-12/pulse rhil-2 to modify       neovascularization and gene expression in the local tumor site, and to induce a measurable       antitumor effect in adults with various advanced and/or refractory solid tumors.        to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of combined systemic administration of       rhil-12/pulse rhil-2.        eligibility:        patients with advanced solid tumors for whom a proven more effective therapy does not exist.       patients with renal cell cancer will be required to have received sunitinib or sorefinib or       refused this option.        the patient must have normal organ function and a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.        normal pulmonary function (as documented by pfts), and for patients over the age of 50,       normal stress thallium testing.        no prior treatment with il-12.        design:        phase i dose escalation with an expansion cohort of 10 patients treated at the maximum       tolerated dose.        patients will be hospitalized for treatment. il-2 will be given intravenously every 8 hours       on day 1 and this will be followed by intravenous administration of il-12 every other day       for three doses on days 2, 4, and 6. after two days of rest the schedule will be repeated.       cycles will be repeated every 36 days.        tumor response will be evaluated after every treatment. stable or responding patients will       continue treatment with evaluations after every cycle of treatment.|completed|april 2000|october 2010|actual|october 2010|actual|phase 1|interventional|endpoint classification: safety study, intervention model: single group assignment, masking: open label, primary purpose: treatment|1||actual|39|||-  inclusion criteria:          adult patients 18 years of age and older.          pathologically or cytologically-proven diagnosis of non-hematologic malignancy, and the         presence of radiographically or clinically evaluable disease.          patients with solid tumors including renal, breast, lung carcinomas, as well as sarcomas         for whom a proven more effective therapy does not exist. patients with renal cell cancer         will have received sunitinib or sorefinib or refused this option.          patients must not have received myelosuppressive chemotherapy, hormonal therapy,         radiotherapy or immunotherapy within four weeks of entry onto this protocol.          estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.          ecog performance status of 0 or 1.          patients must be free of acute infection or other significant systemic illness.          negative serologic testing for hepatitis b will be required to limit confounding variables         in the assessment of the potential hepatic toxicity of this combination.          negative serologic testing for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) will be required given         the uncertain impact of rhil-12 and/or rhil-2 administration on viral replication, and the         potential alterations in immune responsiveness among patients concurrently infected with         hiv.          adequate hepatic and renal function as evidence by:          transaminases less than 2.5 times the upper limit or normal;

         -  to assess the feasibility of using bioinformatics approaches with this database to            examine the possibility that specific snps, in the context of known dosimetric factors,            can predict occurrence of late rectal or bladder toxicity;          -  to perform a proteomic analysis of serum samples from a cohort of 25 patients            experiencing higher levels of ongoing late toxicity and 50 patients with no ongoing            late toxicity.        specific aim 2:          -  to utilize biophysical approaches to modelling clinical complication data, using the            concept of generalized mean biological effective dose (gmbed) and the critical volume            model.        summary: this proposal will be the first comprehensive retrospective analysis of genomic,       proteomic and dosimetric determinants of late radiation injury in prostate cancer. the       investigators have assembled a broad array of expertise from the cci polyomx program (the       only high throughput snp facility in western canada), the nci/fda clinical proteomics       program at bethesda, md, and the unique biophysical modeling capability of cbiar researchers       to reach these goals.|terminated|april 2003|january 2012|actual|january 2012|actual|n/a|observational|observational model: case-only, time perspective: retrospective||1|actual|83|||inclusion criteria:            -  treatment with 3d crt for which follow-up toxicity evaluation was done          exclusion criteria:            -  follow-up less than 18 months|male|n/a|n/a|no|non-probability sample|community sample|april 2012|february 24, 2016|july 20, 2005||no||no||https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct00122265||197769|

carboplatin, and oxaliplatin interactions with plasma proteins||ahs cancer control alberta|no|cisplatin is a widely used anti-tumor agent for the treatment of testicular and ovarian       cancers. carboplatin is used extensively for small cell, non small cell lung cancer and       ovarian cancer. oxaliplatin has recently been approved in the united states (us) for       treatment of colorectal cancer. a large portion (in the range of 65% to 98%) of cisplatin in       the blood plasma was bound to protein within a day after intravenous administration. the       binding of cisplatin and other analogues to proteins and enzymes is generally believed to be       the cause of several severe side effects such as ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. the       interactions between platinum based chemotherapy drugs and proteins is proposed to play       important roles in both drug activity and toxicity. therefore, a better understanding of the       molecular mechanism of platinum-protein interactions may have an impact on optimization of       strategies for treatment. the objective is to develop novel approaches and techniques to       provide detailed mechanistic, kinetic and high-resolution structural information on the       binding of platinum analogues to blood proteins, and to improve treatment efficacy and       reduce side effects.|cisplatin, cis-[pt(nh3)2cl2], is a widely used antitumor agent for the treatment of       testicular and ovarian cancers. carboplatin is used extensively for small cell, non small       cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer. oxaliplatin has recently been approved in the us for       treatment of colorectal cancer. all of these analogues are administered by intravenous       injection, and within one day, 65-98% of the platinum in the blood plasma is bound to       protein. binding of cisplatin to proteins reduces urinary excretion of platinum, and causes       deposition of platinum in tissues. binding of cisplatin to proteins and enzymes is generally       believed to be the cause of several severe side effects exhibited by these drugs, especially       ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.        despite numerous studies of platinum-protein binding in the last few decades, the roles of       platinum-protein adducts in drug action, and in toxicity of these drugs are not known.       although cisplatin-protein adducts are widely believed to cause the drug's side effects,       there are also claims that platinum-protein adducts are important for the drug's activity.       therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of platinum-protein       interactions may have an impact on the optimization of strategies for platinum treatment. it       is important to understand basic principles that govern formation and reactivity of       platinum-protein adducts because these adducts may be important in defining the therapeutic       profile of these drugs. in this quest, the first goal is to develop a reliable technique for       these studies. to date, ultraviolet/visible (uv-vis), fourier transform infrared (ft-ir),       and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) studies of cisplatin-protein interactions have provided       only low-resolution information on the mechanism of the binding or on the nature of the       adducts. the researchers propose to investigate the role of platinum-protein adducts in the       mechanisms of the drug action and their contributions towards the toxicity of these drug.       the short-term objective is to investigate platinum interaction with serum proteins using       both nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry (nanoesi-ms) and a combination of size exclusion       high performance liquid chromatography with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry       (hplc/icp-ms). the long-term objective of this research is to develop biomarkers based on       platinum-protein adducts for clinical monitoring.        initially, metallothionein and human hemoglobin were used as model proteins to develop       nesi/ms and hplc/icp-ms techniques for studying cisplatin-protein interactions in vitro. the       researchers have demonstrated that the combination of size exclusion hplc/icp-ms and       nanoesi/ms provided new information on the adduct formation and potential reaction       mechanism. the size exclusion hplc with icp-ms enables monitoring of cisplatin-protein       binding under physiological conditions. nanospray tandem ms offers information on formation       of specific complexes and on characteristics of binding. this information is useful for a       better understanding of drug toxicity and treatment resistance. the information on       platinum-protein interactions allows us to evaluate the utility of both nanoesi/ms and size       exclusion hplc/icp-ms techniques in providing mechanistic, kinetic and structural       information on the binding of platinum to other proteins. the methodology will be further       validated by studying the platinum-blood protein adducts in cancer patients undergoing       chemotherapeutic treatments. the correlation between the levels of platinum-protein adducts       and clinical outcomes will be studied.        the successful completion of this research program should provide the researchers with a       better understanding of mechanisms of the drug action and toxicity. this knowledge will be       of great importance in clinical monitoring of cancer patients to assist doctors to improve       cancer

prevention of brain and spinal cord            leukemia (cns treatment); and intensification/continuation chemotherapy.          -  the treatment for patients in the "infant/high risk" group consists of four phases of            therapy: induction treatment; infant intensification therapy;            intensification/continuation chemotherapy; and cns treatment.          -  the induction treatment consists of a combination of chemotherapy drugs whose purpose            is to kill all detectable leukemia cells. this process usually requires a least one            month and includes six anti-leukemia drugs. these drugs are: vincristine, doxorubicin,            methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside, asparaginase and steroids (methylprednisolone or            prednisone).          -  after the induction phase, "infant/high risk" patients will receive a highly intensive            month of treatment (infant intensification) . drugs used during this month include            high-dose methotrexate, asparaginase, 6-mercaptopurine and high dose cytosine            arabinoside (ara-c).          -  cns treatment begins during induction therapy but is intensified during the second and            third month after diagnosis. treatment for all patients will include a series of spinal            taps with the instillation of anti-leukemia drugs, including cytosine arabinoside and            methotrexate and with or without hydrocortisone (depending upon randomization).          -  all high risk patients (those in both "high risk" and "infant/high risk") as well as            some standard risk patients will receive radiation treatment to the brain. radiation            therapy will either be given in either "conventional" treatments (once daily for 10            days), or "hyperfractionated" treatments (twice daily at half doses for 10 days). total            dose of radiation is 1800 cgy.          -  intensification and continuation therapy, begins 4-5 weeks after diagnosis for            "standard risk" and "high risk" groups and 4-5 weeks after infant intensification in            "infant/high risk" group. this phase of treatment continues until the completion of two            years of treatment. patients in the "standard risk" group will receive five            anti-leukemia drugs (vincristine, prednisone, methotrexate, asparaginase, and            6-mercaptopurine). patients in "high risk" and "infant/high risk" will receive six            anti-leukemia drugs (vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, methotrexate, asparaginase            and 6-mercaptopurine).          -  all patients will be able to participate in a randomization comparing two types of            asparaginase, e.coli and erwinia. patients will be randomized to receive either once            weekly e.coli or once-weekly erwinia during the intensification phase, each given for a            total of 20 weeks.          -  patients in the "standard risk" group are able to participate in an additional            randomization. standard risk patients will be randomized to receive one of two            different regimens designed to prevent central nervous system leukemia, either            1)radiation therapy (given twice daily) with chemotherapy in the spinal fluid every 18            weeks, or 2) intensive chemotherapy in the spinal fluid alone without radiation.          -  patients in the "high risk" and "infant/high risk" groups are able to participate in            two randomizations in addition to the asparaginase randomization. the first will be to            assess whether the drug dexrazoxane prevents heart damage caused by doxorubicin without            affecting risk of relapse. patients will be randomized to receive either doxorubicin            alone or doxorubicin with dexrazoxane during the induction, cns and intensification            phases. the second randomization will compare the relative efficacy and toxicity of            different cranial radiation schedules. patients will be randomized to receive radiation            in either once daily or twice daily fractions.          -  blood and bone marrow samples will be collected to learn more about the biology of            leukemia. these samples will also be used to test minimal residual disease levels to            learn if these levels help predict risk of relapse.          -  quality of life questionnaires will also be performed by the parents of patients, by            children over eight, and by the child's clinician.|terminated|january 1996|september 2006|actual|september 2006|actual|phase 3|interventional|allocation: randomized, endpoint classification: safety/efficacy study, intervention model: parallel assignment, masking: open label, primary purpose: treatment||||491|||inclusion criteria:            -  acute lymphoblastic leukemia, excluding known mature b-cell all            -  < 18 years of age            -  patients who are leukopheresed or exchanged are eligible for study only after              completion of the pheresis or exchange transfusion            -  absence of a t(8,14) (q24;

cancers|phase ii study of weekly carboplatin and taxotere in platinum sensitive relapsed ovarian or tubal or primary peritoneal cancers||university of saskatchewan||weekly carboplatin and taxotere will be tolerable and effective as second line treatment of       platinum-sensitive ( >6 month treatment free interval) relapsed ovarian cancer        primary efficacy parameter will be response rate (cr and pr) according to recist criteria.        secondary endpoints will be duration of response, progression free survival and overall       survival. toxicity will also be evaluated.|ovarian cancer is the sixth most common malignancy in women, with estimated 2500 cases       diagnosed in 2001, and 1500 deaths. despite maximal cytoreductive therapy, followed normally       by a taxane and carboplatin (or cisplatin) chemotherapy, most patients will relapse, and       require chemotherapy in a palliative setting. the goal of this second line therapy is to       prolong survival and to improve quality of life. this disease has been characterized as       chronic, as many patients may eventually go on to respond to additional lines of therapy.        response to second line therapy has been correlated to length of time since the end of the       first line treatment (treatment free interval, tfi). patients relapsing or progressing while       on therapy are defined as platinum-refractory. in north america the norm is to label       patients with a tfi of 6 months or less as platinum-resistant. a tfi of greater than 6       months would make a patient platinum-sensitive.        these platinum-sensitive patients are generally treated with single agent carboplatin or       carboplatin and taxol by 3-weekly administration. the icon-4 trial published in june 2003       compared single agent platinum to combination of platinum-taxol. patients could have       received one or both of these agents in the adjuvant setting. at a median follow-up of 42       months the absolute difference in 2-year survival was 7% [p=0.0004} in favor of the       combination arm. thus combination platinum-taxol is the present standard of care in       platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. use of taxol is limited by persistent neuropathy       in 20%.        presently there is growing evidence in support of giving chemotherapy at shorter intervals       at low-doses. hypothetically, this allows less advancement of cancer cells through the cell       cycle. moreover weekly taxanes are associated with an anti-angiogenic effect- more so with       taxotere than taxol in cell-lines.        several randomized trials in breast cancer have shown the improved efficacy of weekly taxol       over 3-weekly taxol. the neoadjuvant study showed an increase in pcr [complete response on       pathologic evaluation] of 10%with weekly taxol. the adjuvant study with 2-weekly       chemotherapy showed a 7% improvement in time-to-progression over 3-weekly chemotherapy.        in ovarian cancer- a phase ii study of weekly carboplatin (auc-2) with taxol (80mg/m2/week)       given on day 1,8,15 of 28 day cycles has shown a response rate of 100% [80% cr, 20% pr] in       21 platinum-sensitive patients- with either measurable or evaluable disease. median duration       of response was 11.7 months (95% ci- 8.0-18.5 months). 46% reported grade i neuropathy, 1       patient had febrile neutropenia, and 32% had grade 3 neutropenia.        weekly administration of taxotere with carboplatin has been studied in a phase i study.       maximum tolerated dose was taxotere 35mg/m2 with carboplatin auc-2. at this dose no grade 3       or 4 cytopenias were seen. nor were there significant neuropathies.        our study plans to evaluate taxotere 35mg/m2 with carboplatin at auc-2 given weekly. 3       weekly treatments will constitute one cycle. we expect to see equivalent response rates and       equivalent or higher duration of responses with better toxicity profile.|terminated|october 2003|april 2007|actual|||phase 2|interventional|allocation: non-randomized, endpoint classification: safety/efficacy study, intervention

 combination therapy with intravenous fenoldopam mesylate and mesna will reduce the            incidence of dialysis and all cause mortality at 21 days in patients with established            acute tubular necrosis (atn).          -  the combination of fenoldopam mesylate and intravenous mesna reduces the level of            reactive oxygen species released following restoration of renal blood flow in patients            with ischemic atn.        specific aims          1. to conduct a multicenter, double blind, trial comparing the efficacy of a 72-hour            infusion of fenoldopam mesylate or combination of fenoldopam plus intravenous mesna to            reduce the incidence of dialysis or all-cause mortality at 21 days in patients with            ischemic atn.          2. to determine the effects of fenoldopam mesylate alone or in combination with mesna on            reperfusion injury as evidenced by changes in the level of urinary 15-f2t-isoprostanes            the rational is that failure of parenteral vasodilators to reduce the incidence of            death or dialysis among patients with atn may involve the extension of tubular injury            through normalization of renal blood flow and subsequent reperfusion injury. moreover,            the generation of reactive oxidative species in areas of hypoxia could blunt impair            regional blood flow in the kidney through inhibition of nitric oxide production.          3. to serially measure the urinary content of icam-1, vcam-1, kim-1, p-selectin,            e-selectin, mcp-1and cyr-61 and determine the ability of specific markers to identify            patients progressing to dialysis dependent atn.        the rational is that icam-1 is expressed by ischemic endothelium and facilitates neutrophile       migration into areas of necrotic epithelium. we will determine whether rising urinary icam-1       will identify patients with progressive dialysis-dependent atn. specific aim #3 will also       examine whether a reduction in dialysis or all cause mortality by fenoldopam mesylate       correlates with reduced urinary expression of icam-1 or other cell adhesion molecules. the       serum, plasma, urine supernatant and urinary casts obtained from patients enrolled in this       trial will be made available to other investigators involved in the study of early atn.|withdrawn|august 2008|october 2008|actual|october 2008|actual|phase 2/phase 3|interventional|allocation: randomized, endpoint classification: efficacy study, intervention model: single group assignment, masking: double-blind, primary purpose: treatment|||anticipated|630|||inclusion criteria:            -

with the       exception of a longer half-life which means that it can be administered less frequently       without loosing clinical efficiency. aranesp® has been well tolerated in studies conducted       to this date. in this setting aranesp® appears to be safe and well tolerated. adverse events       reported to date have generally been mild to moderate in severity and consistent with events       and symptoms in cancer patients with chronic disease receiving chemotherapy (i.e. fatigue       and gastrointestinal symptoms). clinical studies have shown a higher frequency of       thromboembolic reactions including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in cancer       patients receiving aranesp therapy compared to patients receiving placebo. the clinical       experience so far with aranesp® has been published (15,16,17). aranesp® is registered for       clinical use in europe and us.        based on this the present study will evaluate the effect of aranesp® on the haematopoietic       response in patients with advanced hormone independent prostate cancer and anemia. moreover,       the effect of aranesp® on quality of life, hemoglobin, necessity for rbc transfusion and       hospital admissions, will be evaluated. the study will be performed as an open randomized       trial. the use of r-huepo in cancer patients has been established and registered in other       settings (as supportive treatment), and it has been shown that the preparation can be given       without significant side effects. on the contrary, it is likely that patients may benefit       from additional improvement in wellbeing.|terminated|october 2006|february 2007|actual|february 2007|actual|phase 2/phase 3|interventional|allocation: randomized, endpoint classification: efficacy study, intervention model: parallel assignment, masking: open label, primary purpose: supportive care|||anticipated|140|||inclusion criteria:            -  male > 18 years            -  histologically proven prostate cell carcinoma            -  progression in psa (10% elevation of nadir-value documented by two tests) at least 4              months after surgical orchiectomy or initiation of lhrh-agonist. testosterone level              must be below castration level            -  all psa values must be > 5 ng/ml            -  haemoglobin level below 11 g/dl (6.8 mmol/l)            -  haemoglobin level tested no later than 14 days prior to randomization            -  a life expectancy of more than 3 months            -  participants must sign informed consent according to local and national regulations              and european clinical trial directive          exclusion criteria:            -  known primary haematological disorder, which could cause anaemia            -  hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmhg), refractory to treatment            -  symptomatic cardiovascular disease            -  history of thromboembolic events during the last 12 months            -  concomitant chemotherapy            -  active and severe liver disease            -  clinical significant inflammatory disease            -  concomitant or previous malignancies, which are likely to influence the treatment,              evaluation and outcome of the current disease and therapy            -  concern of subject's compliance with the protocol procedures            -  previously included into the study            -  received erythropoietic therapy within 4 weeks before inclusion into the study            -  known positive antibody reaction to any erythropoietic agent|male|18 years|n/a|no|||february 2008|december 3, 2015|september 27, 2006||no|terminated by sponsor due to general risk that aranesp caused tumor progression|no||https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct00381836||178313|

parotid salivary sparing||m.d. anderson cancer center|no|primary objective:        to determine if amifostine in combination with imrt can mitigate the decrease in production       of saliva by the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands in patients with hnscc.        secondary objectives:          1. to establish a parotid gland dose volume histogram (dvh) versus measured flow            relationship in this patient population:               -  when the mean dose is < 24-26 gy (shift recovery time to left)               -  when the mean dose is > 24-26 gy (dvh shift)          2. to

and patterns of occipital scalp epilation;          4. to observe the incidence of dysphagia using the list performance status scale (lpss);            and          5. to further evaluate the safety profile of amifostine in this patient population.|amifostine is designed to protect the cells in normal tissues against the toxicities of       chemotherapy and radiation therapy.        before you can start treatment on this study, you will have "screening tests." these tests       will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study.        blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine blood tests. your complete medical       history will be recorded. you will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital       signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate), weight, and height. you       will have a dental exam. you will complete a questionnaire that asks questions about dry       mouth. in addition, you will be asked questions about your diet and eating habits. this       should take no longer than 10 minutes. also, saliva will be collected by a simple, in-office       oral test that measures saliva flow rate over a 5 minute period. women who are able to have       children must have a negative blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) pregnancy test.        if you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive imrt monday       -friday over a 6-7 week period. in addition, 2-3 hours before imrt, you will also take       pre-medications by mouth to prevent potential nausea and skin reactions (anti-nausea &       antihistamine), including drinking water.you will receive daily imrt therapy, excluding       weekends and holidays. the radiation dose is designed to conform to the 3-dimensional shape       of the tumor by controlling the intensity of the radiation beam to focus a higher radiation       dose on the tumor (and not the surrounding normal tissue). thirty (30) to 60 minutes before       every imrt treatment, you will receive study drug in two injections beneath the skin. imrt       will take about 30 minutes to complete.        every day that you are receiving imrt (monday-friday), you will be asked about any drugs you       are taking and any side effects you are experiencing. your vital signs will be recorded.        every week (weeks 2-7), you will have a complete oral and physical exam. you will complete       the questionnaire that asks questions about dry mouth. you will be asked questions about       your ability to perform daily activities (performance status evaluation). your weight will       also be measured. you will be asked to complete the symptom survey (the m.d. anderson       symptom inventory) that will ask you to rate your symptoms and how much the symptoms       interfere in your daily activities.        on the last day you receive imrt or amifostine (whichever is last), you will have a complete       oral exam and you will complete the questionnaire about dry mouth.        six (6) weeks after the end of therapy, you will have an end-of-therapy visit. at this       visit, you will have a complete physical and oral exam with a saliva collection. you will       complete the questionnaire about dry mouth. your weight will be measured, and you will have       a performance status evaluation. blood (about (2) tablespoons) will be drawn for routine       blood tests. you will be asked about any drugs you are taking and any side effects you are       experiencing. in addition, you will be asked questions about your diet and eating habits.        you will be asked to complete the symptom survey (the m.d. anderson symptom inventory) that       will ask you to rate your symptoms and how much the symptoms interfere in your daily       activities every week for 2 months after the end of radiation therapy. after this point, you       will be asked to complete the symptom survey every month for 1 year.        you will have follow-up visits 4, 7, 10, and 12 months after the end of therapy. at these       visits, you will have a complete oral exam and saliva collection. you will complete the dry       mouth questionnaire. your weight will be measured, and you will have a performance status       evaluation and you will be asked questions about your diet and eating habits.        this is an investigational study. amifostine is fda approved and commercially available.       amifostine is fda approved to be given through a needle in your vein but not fda approved to       be given through

injury|double-blind cross-over study of the effect of namenda on short term memory and attention in patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury, protocol nam-md-44||university of missouri-columbia|no|the purpose of this study is to determine whether memantine (namenda) improves memory and       attention in patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury.|background and significance:        each year in the united states approximately 1.5 million people sustain a traumatic brain       injury (tbi) and of these approximately 80-90,000 result in long-term or lifelong       disability. an estimated 5.3 million people are currently living with a disability due to       tbi. the centers for disease control (cdc) estimated that about 75% (1.1 million) of the       reported tbis are concussions or other forms of mild tbis (mtbi). however, the incidence of       mtbi has been vastly underestimated according to a cdc report to congress.        the long term problem associated with mtbi is primarily memory impairment. memory impairment       resulting form mtbi is not likely to improve with time beyond the initial stabilizing period       of about one year post-injury. dementia from alzheimer's disease produces cognitive problems       that are similar to those experienced by patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain       injury. the efficacy of namenda for treatment of cognitive problems due to alzheimer's       dementia suggests it may have efficacy for treatment of short term memory and attention       deficits in patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury.        overall design and plan of study:        twenty post-tbi patients whose tbi occurred at least 1 year prior to beginning the study       will be recruited for this pilot study. patients who meet screening criteria will have       cognitive abilities assessed at baseline and at subsequent visits while taking namenda or       placebo. patients will be randomly assigned to begin either namenda or placebo and will then       crossover to the alternate treatment. each patient will participate in the study for a total       of 32 to 34 weeks. patients completing the study will have 10 total visits and 6 visits at       which a cognitive test battery will be administered. this will include 24 weeks of study       drug treatment (12 weeks of namenda and 12 weeks of placebo) and two 4-week washout periods.       patients will be titrated up to 20 mg of namenda per day. namenda and placebo will be       provided by forest laboratories inc.        cognitive screening criteria include a galveston orientation and amnesia test (goat) score       of at least 75, and either a mini-mental state exam (mmse) score of 20 to 27 obtained at the       screening visit, or a california verbal learning test (cvlt) total score for trials 1-5 one       standard deviation lower than the age matched normative score. the cvlt score for inclusion       may be obtained from the medical record provided that the cvlt testing occurred one year or       more post tbi and within two years of study entry.        the cognitive test battery measurements will be made at the first baseline before namenda or       placebo administration (week 0), and at weeks 6, & 12 after namenda or placebo       administration. after washout for 4 weeks, the second baseline (week 16) will be assessed,       and the cognitive test battery will be administered again at weeks 22 & 28 after namenda or       placebo administration.        the cognitive test battery used to assess efficacy will utilize the following tests;        verbal memory: hopkins verbal learning test revised (hvlt-r). visual memory: brief       visuospatial memory test revised (bvmt-r). speed of processing: trail making test part a.       attention: trail making test part b. memory/processing speed: symbol digit modality test       (sdmt).        the primary endpoints for cognitive assessment will be the hvlt-r and the bvmt-r. the 6       different forms of the hvlt-r and bvmt-r will be administered at each of the 6 cognitive       test battery assessments. the sequence of forms administered will be randomized. the other       listed cognitive tests will be considered secondary endpoints. an additional secondary       efficacy endpoint will be the physicians global impression of change which will be recorded       with the same visit frequency as other cognitive tests.        in addition to the neuropsychological tests, patients will have physical examinations,       electrocardiograms, and laboratory tests of blood and urine. safety and tolerability will be       monitored by clinical assessment, reporting of adverse events, and laboratory values.       patient health will be assessed at clinic visits every 3-6 weeks throughout the study. serum       pregnancy (for females of child bearing potential) will be completed at screening and at       weeks 12 and 28. urine pregnancy tests will be completed at baseline (week 0) and weeks 16 &       32. a safety officer will be utilized as the primary means of monitoring safety of the       study. the safety

         -  what effects, good and/or bad, mgcd0103 and docetaxel have on the subject and on            his/her cancer; and          -  if the genetic and chemical make-up of the subject's blood cells and tumor cells play a            role in how you respond or do not respond to mgcd0103 and docetaxel.|this phase 1 study will evaluate escalating doses of orally administered mgcd0103 in       combination with two fixed doses (60 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2) of iv docetaxel. in the us,       docetaxel is recommended at these or even higher doses (up to 100 mg/m2), both as a single       agent or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs (e.g., cisplatin, doxorubicin,       cyclophosphamide, and 5-fluorouracil), for the treatment of nsclc, prostate cancer, gastric       adenocarcinoma, and head and neck cancer. in japan, 60 mg/m2 iv docetaxel is the approved       dose for the treatment of breast cancer.        mgcd0103 belongs to the class of more selective, less globally cytotoxic agents being       investigated for treatment of cancers today, and may offer a lesser and/or non-overlapping       toxicity profile than the cytotoxic agents with which docetaxel is currently combined.       mgcd0103 doses ranging from 50 to 135 mg have been administered in combination with the       approved regimen of azacitidine (vidaza®) (75 mg/m2/day for 5 days every 4 weeks) to       patients with high-risk mds and aml. a 50 mg dose of mgcd0103 has been administered in       combination with the approved regimen of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 once weekly for 3       consecutive weeks of each 4-week cycle) to patients with advanced solid tumors; higher doses       of mgcd0103 will soon be evaluated in that trial.        given the above, the proposed starting dose of 60 mg/m2 iv docetaxel and 50 mg mgcd0103 is       considered appropriately safe for initial investigation of this combination. based on the       results observed in part 1, the study may also evaluate 75 mg/m2 iv docetaxel and escalating       doses of orally administered mgcd0103 in part 2 in order to determine whether this dosing       regimen is safe and would also warrant further investigation.|terminated|august 2007|march 2009|actual|march 2009|actual|phase 1|interventional|allocation: non-randomized, endpoint classification: safety study, intervention model: single group assignment, masking: open label, primary purpose: treatment|2||anticipated|54|||inclusion criteria:          subjects must meet all inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study            -  age ≥18 years.            -  diagnosis of malignant solid tumor (histologically or cytologically confirmed) where              treatment with docetaxel is considered standard of care, or advanced solid malignancy              that has failed to respond to standard therapy, or has progressed despite standard              therapy, or where there is no reasonable likelihood of achieving clinical benefit              with existing therapies.            -  eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance status 0 to 2.            -  adequate organ function, including: hemoglobin (hgb) ≥8.0g/dl;

  (17p chromosomal deletions, or both 3p and 9p chromosomal deletions), severe dysplasia,            cis, or cancer of the o/op cavity in patients who are at high risk for squamous cell            carcinoma, carcinoma in situ, or severe dysplasia of the oral/oropharyngeal (o/op)            cavity due to their age and lifestyle risk factors.          2. to obtain the adjusted specificity of oratest® in combination with visual examination            in the detection of certain chromosomal abnormalities (17p chromosomal deletions, or            both 3p and 9p chromosomal deletions), severe dysplasia, cis or cancer of the o/op            cavity.          3. to evaluate the chromosomal status of the positively staining lesions with respect to            3p, 9p, or 17p deletions.          4. to carry out gene expression studies on biopsies and map these onto an analysis of the            widespread chromosomal imbalances in stain-positive and stain-negative lesions.          5. to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicities, as well as other safety            parameters, of tolonium chloride 5 mg/ml (oratest®).|oratest® is a blue dye that is designed to stain cancer cells differently than normal cells.        scheduled evaluation (first visit):        before you can start treatment on this study, you will have "screening tests." these tests       will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. your medical       history will be recorded. women who are able to have children must have a negative urine       pregnancy test. your heart rate, breathing, temperature, and blood pressure will be measured       before as well as after the first visit.        visual exam - if you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have a       visual examination where a doctor (examiner #1) will look inside your mouth very carefully       to look for any abnormal lesions and check the glands in your neck. this is called the       visual exam.        rinse staining procedure (oratest®) - a second doctor (examiner #2) will perform another       oral exam, followed by the new test using oratest®. this new test uses a blue dye which may       stain any potential cancer blue so it may make it easier for the doctor to detect any       abnormal lesions in your mouth. you will be asked not to have intensely-colored sweets like       lollipops or drinks like black currant juice within 24 hours of your scheduled visit. first       you will rinse your mouth with about 6 teaspoons of vinegar solution for about 20 seconds       and spit it out. next you will rinse your mouth with 6 teaspoons of water for 20 seconds and       spit it out. then you will rinse your mouth with about 2 teaspoons of oratest® for 20       seconds and spit it out. then you will rinse your mouth with about 6 teaspoons of vinegar       solution for 20 seconds and then spit it out. then you will rinse your mouth with 6       teaspoons of water for 20 seconds and spit it out. examiner 2 will then check and see if any       abnormal tissue absorbed the dye.        if no suspicious lesions are found by either doctor, you will have completed the study. you       will be asked to notify the clinic, by phone, if any side effects occur within 7 days after       your visit. if you are unable to phone the clinic, you will be given diary cards to record       these side effects. the diary cards are to be mailed to the doctor in the pre-stamped       envelope given to you.        if any suspicious lesions are found by either doctor (or both), then you will be asked to       return in about 2 weeks to confirm the result. this is called the confirmation exam.        confirmation exam (second visit):        at the visit to confirm the result, you will be examined by the same doctor(s) who found the       suspicious lesion(s). the doctor(s) will use the same examination method that was used       during the first visit. your heart rate, breathing, temperature, and blood pressure will be       measured before as well as after the second visit.        if you have any suspicious lesions, a specialist at m. d. anderson will biopsy your       lesion(s), at this second visit or within 5 days after the visit. during the biopsy, the       doctor may use the oratest® cotton swab to help locate the suspicious spot. if the dye is       used at the biopsy visit, your heart rate, breathing, temperature, and blood pressure will       be measured before and after the use of oratest®. after locating the spot, the doctor will       perform the biopsy. this means that some tissue lining in your mouth from the suspicious       area will be removed. some of your tissue will be sent to a laboratory for diagnosis. your       doctor will decide the type of care you may need based on the results of the biopsy. the       biopsy procedure is standard practice and may happen even if you did not participate in this       study. after the biopsy is taken of the lesion, you will have completed the study.        if a suspicious lesion is found and you are required to have a biopsy, a sample of tissue       from the biopsy will be sent to a laboratory outside of m.d. anderson for review and       diagnosis. medical research including genetic testing, chromosomal analysis and other tests       may be performed on your biopsy. these samples cannot be returned to you because the tissue       is destroyed during the genetic tests. before your tissue is sent to the outside laboratory       your name and any personal identifying information will be coded to protect your privacy. m.       d. anderson will not have oversight of any leftover tissue and/or blood that will be banked       by brt laboratories inc. for additional research.        if no suspicious lesions are seen at this second visit, then you have completed the study.       if the dye was used during the exam, then you will be asked to notify the clinic by phone if       any side effects occur within 7 days after your visit. if you are unable to phone the       clinic, you will be given diary cards to record these side effects. the diary cards are to       be mailed to the doctor in the pre-stamped envelope given to you.        this is an investigational study. oratest® has not yet been fda approved for commercial use.       all study procedures and oratest® will be provided free of charge; the sponsor will pay for       the study drug and pregnancy test if necessary. if further standard of care is needed (for       example, due to abnormalities found), you and/or your insurance company will be responsible       for the cost. insurance companies and medicare may not pay for the costs of some research       studies like this one. if your insurance company does not cover the cost of care, then you       will have to pay these costs. you have the right to ask what it will cost you to take part       in this study or to have other treatments. if you withdraw from the study early, you will       only be paid for the portion of the study that you completed. up to 4000 patients will take       part in this multicenter study. up to 50 will be enrolled at m. d. anderson.|terminated|february 2007|december 2008|actual|december 2008|actual|phase 3|interventional|intervention model: single

there remains no consensus on       the second-line treatment of agvhd.        acute graft-versus-host-disease (agvhd) is mediated by donor t-cells. the preventative and       therapeutic strategies described above have therefore focused on quantitative reduction in t       cells or reduction of their function through immune-modulation. the role of b-lymphocytes in       the pathogenesis of ghvd is unclear. recent reports of successful use of rituximab in cgvhd       support the hypothesis that a coordinated b and t cell response is instrumental in cgvhd.       the significance of b-cells in pathogenesis of agvhd is unknown.        steroid refractory acute graft-versus-host-disease (sr-agvhd) initial treatment for agvhd       routinely consists of intensifying the dose of corticosteroids. this condition is called       steroid-resistant (sr) agvhd and requires secondary intervention.        rituximab is a human/murine chimeric monoclonal anti cd-20 antibody that is extensively used       in patients with b-cell non-hodgkin's lymphoma, or with autoimmune disease. the incidental       observation of improvement in agvhd following rituximab infusion for transplant-associated       thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (ta-ttp) and subsequent complete resolution of       multi-agent refractory agvhd in two patients forms the basis of this proposed pilot study.       table-2 (in full protocol) describes the patients and their responses to rituximab at our       own institution.|withdrawn|june 2007|||||phase 2|interventional|allocation: non-randomized, endpoint classification: safety/efficacy study, intervention model: single group assignment, masking: open label, primary purpose: treatment|1||actual|0|||inclusion criteria:            1. diagnosis of acute graft-versus-host disease (agvhd)            2. steroid-refractory agvhd with any of the following: a) no change in the stage of skin              agvhd after 1 week of 2 mg/kg per day or more methylprednisolone. b) progression of              acute gvhd (ie, increase in disease stage by at least 1) of skin gvhd or lack of              response of visceral (liver, gi) agvhd despite treatment with 2 mg/kg per day or more              methylprednisolone for at least 72 hours. c) progression of visceral agvhd despite              treatment with 2 mg/kg per day or more methylprednisolone for at least 48 hours d)              visceral agvhd progressing to stage 4 after 24 hours of 2 mg/kg per day or more              methylprednisolone.            3. grade ii-iv agvhd requiring systemic therapy within 24-48 hours of diagnosis. biopsy              confirmation of agvhd is strongly recommended but not required;

like to treat patients using bone marrow transplantation, a treatment that has been       used for people with scd. the transplant uses healthy "matched" bone marrow. this comes from       a brother or sister who does not have sickle cell disease or severe thalassemia. if the       treatment works, the sickle cell disease or thalassemia may be cured. this treatment has       been used to treat patients with sickle cell disease or thalassemia. it has worked in most       cases. we hope, but cannot promise, that the transplanted marrow will make healthy cells,       and patients will not have sickle cell disease or severe thalassemia anymore.        we do not know what effect this treatment will have on the damage that has already been done       by the disease. finding that out is the main reason for this study. currently, very little       has been reported about organ function after bone marrow transplants in patients with sickle       cell anemia.|prior to any bone marrow transplant, we will need patients to:          -  answer questions about their medical history;          -  undergo a physical examination;          -  have tests done to see how well the lungs are working;          -  have a chest x-ray;          -  have an ekg to look at the heart;          -  have an mri & mra (magnetic resonance angiography, which looks at the blood vessels and            the blood flowing through them). these 2 tests will look to see if the patient has had            any strokes;          -  have a pet scan to look at the head and body;          -  have a liver biopsy to determine if the liver has been damaged (which can happen from            iron overload that happens after many transfusions). too much liver damage would mean a            transplant cannot be done.        for the liver biopsy, the skin is numbed with medicine, and a special needle goes into the       liver. the needle removes a very small piece of the liver (tissue). the tissue is taken and       examined.        also, about 30 cc (2 tablespoons) of blood will be drawn to test the blood for viruses,       including hiv (the virus that causes aids). if the hiv test is positive, a transplant will       not be done because it would be too dangerous for the patient.        at least 2 weeks before the bone marrow infusion, the patient will be immunized with prevnar       7. prevnar 7 is a vaccine that is used in children to protect against some types of bacteria       called streptococcus pneumoniae, which can cause the lung infection called pneumonia. people       with sickle cell anemia are at a higher risk of dying from an infection from this type of       bacteria. although children are regularly given the prevnar 7 vaccine, it is not common to       test a child's immune response to the vaccine. in this study, we will check the immune       system's response to the vaccine by drawing an extra 3 ml (less than 1 teaspoon) of blood 3       weeks after the patient gets the prevnar 7 vaccine.        just before the bone marrow transplant, we must kill the cells in the bone marrow that make       the abnormal red blood cells found in patients with severe thalassemia or sickle cell       disease. we will do this by using 3 drugs: busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and campath-1h.       campath-1h is used to prevent the body from rejecting or refusing to let the donor blood       cells grow in the body. mesna is given with the cyclophosphamide to prevent kidney damage.       methotrexate and cyclosporin are also given to prevent graft-versus-host disease (gvhd);       methylprednisolone will be given after the bone marrow infusion if the patient develops       gvhd. a drug will also be given to prevent seizures (either dilantin or lorazepam).        graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) is a possible side-effect of the transplant. in gvhd, some       cells in the donor marrow attack cells in the patient's body. this causes skin, liver, and       bowel problems, and may damage other parts of the body. often, these problems are fairly       mild, but they can be severe or even cause death. severe gvhd is likely to occur in about       10% of patients.        after the patient gets the drug treatment, they will be given bone marrow from a brother or       sister who has healthy bone marrow that matches the patients. the healthy bone marrow will       be put into a vein (given iv) in the same way that blood transfusions are given. the marrow       cells then travel to the right places in the body, where they should grow and make new       normal blood cells.        this is the treatment schedule:        protocol day & treatment:        14 or more days before the bone marrow infusion -- prevnar 7 vaccine        10 days before the bone marrow infusion -- begin dilantin or lorazepam (to prevent seizures)        9 days before the bone marrow infusion -- busulfan        8 days before the bone marrow infusion -- busulfan        7 days before the bone marrow infusion -- busulfan        6 days before the bone marrow infusion -- busulfan        5 days before the bone marrow infusion -- campath 1h, cyclophosphamide, and mesna        4 days before the bone marrow infusion -- campath 1h, cyclophosphamide, and mesna        3 days before the bone marrow infusion -- campath 1h, cyclophosphamide, and mesna        2 days before the bone marrow infusion -- campath 1h, cyclophosphamide, mesna, and       cyclosporin        1 day before the bone marrow infusion -- day of rest        day "0" -- bone marrow infusion given        1 day after the bone marrow infusion -- methotrexate        3 days after the bone marrow infusion -- methotrexate        6 days after the bone marrow infusion -- methotrexate        11 days after the bone marrow infusion -- methotrexate        after transplant, filgrastrim, a growth hormone for the bone marrow, may be given       intravenously (through a vein), if medically necessary.        sometimes, the donor's bone marrow does not grow. then, the patient would be without working       bone marrow cells. so that we will be ready to treat this problem if it happens, we will       take bone marrow from the hip bone before the patient gets the drug treatment. the patient       will be asleep (sedated) when the marrow is taken, and they will be given medicine for any       pain they have afterwards. this bone marrow will be frozen and stored or preserved. if the       donor bone marrow does not grow, we will thaw the stored marrow and put it back into the       body. this stored bone marrow should grow and produce working blood cells. if the stored       bone marrow must be given back, the disease will not be cured.        to tell whether the transplant has worked or "engrafted", we will take samples of bone       marrow (bone marrow aspirate). we will do this 3 weeks after the transplant to make sure the       new cells are beginning to grow. we will take another marrow sample at 3 months after the       transplant. we want to make sure the new cells are still growing. this test will take about       30 to 45 minutes. because this test is painful, the patient will be given pain medicine       before, during, and after the test.        the patient will need to be in the hospital for at least 3 weeks after the transplant to       make sure the transplant has engrafted. we will do several tests (of the lung, kidney, and       liver) before and after the bone marrow transplant. we want to find out how much the       treatment has helped the patient and how much it might help other patients. most tests will       be done every week for 4 months and at each visit to the hospital. also, we will be looking       at the immune function. to do this, we will take about 8 ml (less than 2 teaspoonful) at 6       months, 1 year, and 2 years after the transplant. when possible, we will take the blood from       an iv line that the patient already has. however, at times we will have to draw the blood       with another needle stick. a total amount of 200 ml (about 13 tablespoons) of blood will be       collected from the patient during the entire study.        after 4 months, if the patient's health is good, they will not need to come to the hospital       so often. the visits to the doctor should be more like they were before the bone marrow       transplant. since problems may happen months after the transplant and this is a new way to       treat sickle cell disease and thalassemia the patient will need to have exams and blood       tests done every few months during the first and second years after their transplant. after       that, if all is well, the patient will need to be examined and have blood tests 4 times a       year.|terminated|july 2005|july 2012|actual|july 2012|actual|n/a|interventional|endpoint classification: efficacy study, intervention model: single group assignment, masking: open label, primary

eortc||rationale: monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different       ways. some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. others find tumor cells and       help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. cetuximab may also stop the growth       of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. radiation therapy uses high energy x-       rays to kill tumor cells. cetuximab may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation       therapy. drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor       cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. it is not yet known       which regimen of radiation therapy, combination chemotherapy, and cetuximab and is most       effective in treating patients with head and neck cancer.        purpose: this randomized phase ii trial is comparing two different regimens of radiation       therapy given together with combination chemotherapy and cetuximab to see how well they work       in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage iii or stage iv head and neck cancer that       cannot be removed by surgery.|objectives:          -

although for ethical and other reasons no studies have provided pretreatment       before trauma exposure in humans. no studies have looked at the ability of antidepressants       to treat early ptsd, which we are seeing in great numbers in veterans returning from oif.       this is important, since medications are not without side effects, and we cannot assume that       early ptsd in iraq veterans is the same as, for example, chronic vietnam-related ptsd.       obtaining information about the risks and benefits of early treatment of ptsd in oif       veterans is critical to guiding treatment approaches to this emerging population. in       addition, little is known about potential biomarkers of treatment response. we are working       with the georgia national guard 48th combat brigade to evaluate the health needs of       returning oif veterans, and have started an oif/oef trauma clinic at the atlanta vamc where       the pi is screening returning oif veterans. we now propose to compare paroxetine and to       placebo in returning oif veterans who have returned from iraq in the past six months, who       meet criteria for early ptsd. assessment of ptsd symptoms, hippocampal volume and naa,       neuropsychological testing of memory, and cortisol response to an iraq-related traumatic       script before and after the intervention are proposed to provide information about the       effects of the interventions on ptsd symptoms and stress-responsive hormonal systems.|withdrawn|september 2008|april 2011|actual|april 2011|actual|n/a|interventional|allocation: randomized, endpoint classification: efficacy study, intervention model: parallel assignment, masking: double-blind, primary purpose: treatment|2||actual|0|||inclusion criteria:            -  male and female veterans age 18-50            -  returned from iraq theater within the past six months            -  screen positive for ptsd related to iraq deployment based on the ptsd checklist            -  confirmed with ptsd based on the caps, including one month duration of symptoms            -  being discharged from active service from iraq            -  provide written informed consent          exclusion criteria:            -  history of loss of consciousness of more than one minute            -  psychotropic medication use within the previous four weeks            -  history (based on the scid) of lifetime or current alcohol or substance              abuse/dependence, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder.            -  positive urine toxicology screen            -  history of pre-deployment-related ptsd or partial ptsd based on the caps            -  history of ptsd or partial ptsd related to a prior deployment            -  serious medical or neurological illness            -  pregnancy            -  history of asthma            -  steroid usage, both inhaled and oral            -  seizure disorder            -  prenatal/perinatal substance exposure or trauma.|both|18 years|50 years|no|||june 2015|june 25, 2015|march 17, 2008|yes|yes|withdrawn by funding source|no||https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct00641173||158799|

(avoid mechanical damage to            the device, such as twisting, kinking, or exerting force during insertion).          -  pull the sheath back at least 4 centimeters (cm) (the light source has to remain in            position and not be pulled back with the sheath).          -  verify the light source tip location by ct. reposition if necessary.          -  the sheath may be removed completely, after verifying light source tip location, at the            physician's discretion          -  record distance to lesion surface and to vital structures of the implanted light            source.          -  secure the light source        ls11 administration:          -  since compatibility between ls11 and other drugs is not established, ls11 should not be            mixed with or physically added to other drugs.          -  every effort should be made to avoid extravasation of ls11 in the surrounding tissue.            the extravasated drug may pose prolonged photosensitivity risk to the tissue near the            injection site.          -  to avoid extravasation, establish an intravenous (iv) line and ensure that there is a            free flow of saline or dextrose and water. if a heparin lock is used, flush thoroughly            with saline.          -  ls11 should be slowly (over 3-5 minutes) administered intravenously as a single dose of            30 mg/m2 or 40 mg/m2.          -  following the injection the line should be flushed with at least 10 cc of saline or            dextrose and water.          -  in case of extravasation, the site should be thoroughly rinsed with saline or water and            carefully bandaged to protect the area from room- and sun-light. the photosensitivity            at the extravasated site will last longer than general cutaneous photosensitivity.          -  record the administration start time and end time.        physical exam, blood tests, electrocardiogram (ecg) and magnetic resonance imaging (mri)       will be performed prior to starting on study and regularly after the treatment per protocol.        light exposure precautions following pdt-instructions for patients: patients will be       sensitive to light and must observe precautions to reduce exposure of skin and eyes to       direct sunlight and bright indoor lighting for up to 14 days. the sensitivity to light is       due to residual drug that will be present in all parts of the skin and eyes. to minimize       skin reactions due to light exposure after ls11 administration, precautions should be taken       as detailed in the protocol.|terminated|july 2008|july 2012|actual|july 2012|actual|phase 1|interventional|endpoint classification: safety study, intervention model: single group assignment, masking: open label, primary purpose: treatment|1||actual|7|||inclusion criteria:            -  age: patients must be ≥ 3 and ≤ 21 years of age.            -  tumor: patients must have a debilitating, severely disfiguring, life-threatening, or              progressive plexiform neurofibroma (pn), which is not surgically resectable and for              which there is no other standard medical management.            -  measurable disease: patients must have a measurable pn assessed by mri within 2 weeks              prior to starting therapy.            -  tumor size/shape/location:all tumors must:                 1. have a minimum dimension that is ≥ 5 cm in the plane of intended 25mm length                   light source insertion                 2. have a minimum dimension that is ≥ 3.15 cm perpendicular to the plane of                   intended 25mm length light source insertion                 3. be accessible for percutaneous ct (and ultrasound if needed) guided light source                   insertion;

2. to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib when       administered with protracted, daily tmz among recurrent malignant glioma patients who are on       and not on cyp-3a enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (eiaeds); 3. to evaluate for       anti-tumor activity with this regimen in this patient population.|this is an open-label, single center, one-arm phase i dose-escalation study of dasatinib       plus protracted , daily tmz administered orally on a continuous daily dosing schedule among       adult patients with recurrent or relapsing malignant glioma. the study format includes a       classical "3+3" dose escalation design to determine the mtd and dlt of dasatinib plus       protracted, daily tmz among recurrent malignant glioma patients. patients will be stratified       based on whether they are receiving eiaed and each stratum will independently dose escalate.       additionally, the study will characterize the safety, tolerability, biologic activity, and       pharmacokinetic profile of dasatinib when used in combination with protracted, daily tmz.        patients will start treatment on day 1 of cycle 1 with dasatinib. for patients undergoing       dasatinib pharmacokinetic (pk) analysis, dasatinib will be administered alone until initial       pk assessments are collected. protracted tmz will be initiated after initial dasatinib pk       assessments are collected and will continue to be administered with dasatinib on a       continuous daily dosing schedule. the initial dasatinib pk assessments will be collected       over 24 hours between days 3-7 of cycle 1. patients not undergoing dasatinib pk collections       will begin both dasatinib and protracted, daily tmz together on day 1, cycle 1.        the protracted, daily tmz dose will be 50 mg/m² daily for all patients. the dose level of       dasatinib will be increased in successive cohorts. cohorts of 3-6 patients will accrue at       each dose level until mtd is defined. each cohort will consist of a minimum of 3 newly       enrolled patients. intra-patient dose escalation is not permitted. it is estimated that this       study will enroll a minimum of 30 patients (up to 4 dose levels/stratum;

 to evaluate engraftment by peripheral blood chimerism analysis.          -  to determine the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease            following the transplant.          -  to examine the possibility of controlling hematologic malignancies by induction of a            graft-versus-leukemia/tumor effect.          -  to determine the disease-free survival, relapse, transplant-related mortality, and            death from all causes.        outline:          -

"overexpress" means that the       cancer cells have too many of these receptors. er and pgr are hormone receptors that are       located on some types of breast cancer cells. when these receptors are present, the hormones       estrogen and progesterone are able to tell cancer cells to grow and divide.        this kind of breast cancer does not have an over-production (overexpression) of these three       receptors, and that is why we call it "triple-negative" breast cancer.        we are trying to find new and better treatments for women with triple negative breast       cancer. we do not know what causes triple negative breast cancers to grow. other research       studies have shown that "triple negative" breast cancers overexpress different types of       receptors. these receptors might help the cancer to grow.        we will be testing a drug called dasatinib. dasatinib is a drug that is made by       bristol-myers squibb. it is sold under the name of sprycel. it was first used to treat       patients with leukemia, a type of blood cancer.        dasatinib interferes with the growth of some cancers. dasatinib attaches to the cancer cell       and slows down or stops the cancer cell from growing. it is approved by the food and drug       administration (fda), but not for the kind of cancer that you have been diagnosed with.|terminated|december 2008|february 2011|actual|february 2011|actual|phase 2|interventional|endpoint classification: safety/efficacy study, intervention model: single group assignment, masking: open label, primary purpose: treatment|1||actual|22|||inclusion criteria:            -

 to investigate the differential biological effects in tumor tissues through            pharmacodynamic endpoints (percent inhibition of perk, pkdr, and pegfr) and their            correlation with pharmacokinetics of vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in            patients with advanced solid tumors.          -  to correlate the pharmacodynamic endpoints with the pharmacokinetics of this            combination regimen in these patients.          -  to recommend an optimal biological dose of this combination regimen for further            testing.        secondary          -  to correlate the pharmacokinetics with safety profiles of two dose levels of vandetanib            when given in combination with docetaxel.          -  to investigate scientific correlates, including serum proteomics and microvessel            density (cd31) and cell death (tunel) using tumor tissue biopsy samples taken at            baseline and during treatment.          -  to determine the objective response in patients with measurable disease at baseline.        outline: this is a multicenter study.        patients receive docetaxel iv over 1 hour on day 1 and oral vandetanib once daily on days       1-21. courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable       toxicity. after 6 weeks of treatment, patients who experience clinical benefit but poor       tolerance to docetaxel may continue treatment with vandetanib alone.        plasma samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic analysis, measurement of       vandetanib trough levels, serum biomarker analysis, and serum proteomics. tumor tissue       samples are collected at baseline and once between days 36-38 for pharmacodynamic analysis.        after completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 28 days.|withdrawn|september 2008|||september 2009|anticipated|phase 1|interventional|masking: open label, primary purpose: treatment|||actual|0|||disease characteristics:            -

 human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (her-2) is a gene found in both normal cells            and cancer cells. extra copies of the gene (overexpression) can cause too many her-2            proteins (receptors) to appear on the cell surface and cause tumors to grow.          -  an experimental procedure developed for treating patients with cancer uses blood cells            found in their tumors or bloodstream. the cells are genetically modified using the            anti-her-2 gene and a type of virus. the modified cells (anti-her-2 cells) are grown in            the laboratory and then given back to the patient to try to decrease the size of the            tumors. this is called gene therapy.        objectives:          -  to determine whether advanced cancers that overexpress her-2 can be treated effectively            with lymphocytes (white blood cells) that have been genetically engineered to contain            an anti-her-2 protein.        eligibility:          -  patients 18 years of age and older with metastatic cancer (cancer that has spread            beyond the original site) and for whom standard treatments are not effective.          -  patient's tumor overexpresses her-2.        design:          -  workup with scans, x-rays and other tests.          -  leukapheresis to obtain cells for preparing the anti-her-2 cells for later infusion.          -  1 week of chemotherapy to prepare the immune system for receiving the anti-her-2 cells.          -  infusion of anti-her-2 cells, followed by interleukin-2 (il-2) treatment. the cells are            given as an infusion through a vein. il-2 is given as a 15-minute infusion through a            vein every 8 hours for a maximum of 15 doses.          -  periodic follow-up clinic visits after hospital discharge for physical examination,            review of treatment side effects, laboratory tests and scans every 1 to 6 months.|background:          -  we have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains a chimeric t cell receptor            (car) that recognizes the her-2 tumor antigen, which can be used to mediate genetic            transfer of this car with high efficiency (greater than 30%) without the need to            perform any selection.          -  in co-cultures with her-2 positive tumors, anti-her-2 car transduced t cells secreted            significant amount of interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) (her-2 high specificity).        objectives:        primary objectives:          -  to evaluate the safety of the administration of anti-her-2 -car engineered peripheral            blood lymphocytes in patients receiving the non-myeloablative conditioning regimen and            aldesleukin.          -  determine if the administration of anti-her-2 -car engineered peripheral blood            lymphocytes and aldesleukin to patients following a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid            depleting preparative regimen will result in clinical tumor regression in patients with            metastatic cancer that expresses the her-2 antigen.        secondary objective:        - determine the in vivo survival of car gene-engineered cells.        eligibility:        patients who are 18 years of age or older must have          -  metastatic cancer whose tumors express the her-2 antigen;          -  previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred after standard care            for metastatic disease;        patients may not have:        - contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.        design:          -  peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) obtained by leukapheresis (approximately 5            times 10^9 cells) will be cultured in the presence of anti-cd3 (okt3) and aldesleukin            in order to stimulate t-cell growth.          -  transduction is initiated by exposure of approximately 10^8 to 5 times 10^8 cells to            retroviral vector supernatant containing the anti-her-2 car genes .          -  patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen            consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous (iv) infusion of            ex vivo tumor reactive, car genetransduced pbmc plus iv aldesleukin (720,000 iu/kg q8h            for a maximum of 15 doses).          -  patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor with physical examination, computed            tomography (ct) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and clinical laboratory evaluation            four to six weeks after treatment. if the patient has stable disease (sd) or tumor            shrinkage, repeat complete evaluations will be performed every 1-3 months. after the            first year, patients continuing to respond will continue to be followed with this            evaluation every 3-4 months until off study criteria are met.          -  the study will be conducted using a phase i/ii optimal design. the protocol will            proceed in a phase 1 dose escalation design, with three cohorts. should a single            patient experience a dose limiting toxicity (dlt) at a particular dose level, three            more patients would be treated at that dose to confirm that no greater than 1/6            patients have a dlt prior to proceeding to the next higher level. if a level with 2 or            more dlts in 3-6 patients has been identified, three additional patients will be            accrued at the next-lowest dose, for a total of 6, in order to further characterize the            safety of the maximum tolerated dose prior to starting the phase ii portion. if a dose            limiting toxicity occurs in the first cohort, that cohort will be expanded to 6            patients. if 2 dlts are encountered in this cohort, the study will be terminated.          -  once the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) has been determined, the study then would proceed            to the phase ii portion. patients will be entered into two cohorts based on histology:            cohort 1 will include patients with metastatic breast cancer, and cohort 2 will include            patients with other types of metastatic cancer that express her-2.          -  for each of the 2 strata evaluated, the study will be conducted using a phase ii            optimal design where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled. for each of            these two arms of the trial, if 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a clinical            response, then no further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the first 21            evaluable patients enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will continue until            a total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled in that stratum.          -  the objective will be to determine if the combination of high dose aldesleukin,            lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy, and anti-her-2 car-gene engineered lymphocytes is            able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in            favor of a modest 20% partial response (pr) + complete response (cr) rate (p1=0.20).|terminated|november 2008|december 2010|actual|december 2010|actual|phase 1/phase 2|interventional|endpoint classification: safety/efficacy study, intervention model: single group assignment, masking: open label, primary purpose: treatment|1||actual|1|||-  inclusion criteria:                 1. metastatic cancer that expresses her-2 at greater than or equal to 2+ and                   assessed by immunohistochemistry (ihc) in the clinical laboratory improvement                   amendment (clia) approved test in the laboratory of pathology, center for cancer                   research (ccr), national cancer institute (nci), national institutes of health                   (nih).                 2. patients must have previously received systemic standard care (or effective                   salvage chemotherapy regimens) for metastatic disease, if known to be effective                   for that disease, and have been either non-responders (progressive disease) or                   have recurred. subjects with estrogen receptor-positive or progesterone                   receptor-positive breast cancer must have progressed on or not be a candidate                   for anti-estrogens or aromatase inhibitors and all breast cancer patients must                   have progressed on or not be a candidate for an anthracycline-containing regimen                   and a taxane-containing regimen.                 3. patients with breast cancer must have previously received trastuzumab. patients                   will not continue to receive trastuzumab during the trial period.                 4. greater than or equal to 18 years of age.                 5. willing to sign a durable power of attorney                 6. able to understand and sign the informed consent document                 7. clinical performance status of eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) 0 or 1.                 8. life expectancy of greater than three months.                 9. patients of both genders must be willing to practice birth control from the time                   of enrollment on this study and for up to four months after receiving the                   preparative regimen.                10. serology:                      1. seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) antibody.

gliomas||national institutes of health clinical center (cc)|yes|background:        one way tumors are able to grow is by forming new blood vessels that supply them with       nutrients and oxygen.        sunitinib blocks certain proteins on the surface of tumor and blood vessel cells that are       involved with the formation of new blood vessels.        blocking these proteins may prevent the tumor cells or blood vessels from continuing to       grow.        objectives:        to determine whether sunitinib can cause tumors to shrink or stabilize in patients with       recurrent brain cancer.        eligibility:        patients 18 years of age or older with brain cancer whose disease has worsened after       standard treatment with surgery, radiation.        design:        patients take a sunitinib pill once a day in 4-week treatment cycles. treatment may continue       as long as the tumor remains stable or decreases in size and the side effects of treatment       are tolerated.        routine blood tests are done every 2 weeks during the first 8 weeks of treatment and then       every 4 weeks after that.        magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans are done before starting treatment (at baseline) and       at the end of every 4-week cycle to monitor tumor growth.        positron emission tomography (pet) scans are done at baseline and at the end of the first       cycle.        neurological and physical examinations are done at baseline, at week 2 of treatment and at       the end of every treatment cycle.        health-related quality of life is assessed every 4 weeks.        pregnancy tests, electrocardiograms and echocardiograms are repeated as needed.|background:        solid tumors have multiple mechanisms for stimulating angiogenesis with the vascular       endothelial growth factor (vegf)-kinase insert domain receptor (kdr) axis being only one of       them. sunitinib, through its multiple tyrosine kinase receptor targets, represents an       attempt to capitalize on the concept of targeting multiple mechanisms responsible for       glioma-associated angiogenesis. sunitinib inhibits platelet derived growth factor receptor       (pdgfr) and c-kit (stem cell factor (scf) receptor) at nanomolar concentrations. the       combination blocks all three known major glioma-mediated angiogenic mechanisms (vegf, c-kit,       pdgf). based on this scientific rationale, the promising anti-glioma activity of sunitinib       in preclinical models, and the promising clinical data in patients with gliomas treated with       other vegf inhibitors, we are now proposing a phase ii trial of sunitinib in patients with       recurrent malignant gliomas.        objectives:        to evaluate the anti-glioma activity of sunitinib in patients with recurrent malignant       gliomas who are either naive or resistant to prior bevacizumab therapy.        eligibility:        patients with recurrent malignant glioma are eligible for this study.        design:        this is a phase ii study with a target enrollment of 64 (32 with glioblastoma multiforme       (gbm) and 32 with anaplastic glioma (ag)) patients who have not progressed on prior       treatment with anti-vegf therapy, and 64 (32 with gbm and 32 with ag)patients who have       progressed on prior bevacizumab therapy.        sunitinib will be self-administered orally at 37.5 mg daily, with dose adjustments allowed       for toxicity and concomitant drug interactions.        the primary endpoint is six-month progression free survival for both arms of the study.        we performed an interim analysis (see below) and after consulting with the pharmaceutical       company (pfizer) we believe that ending the study is the most appropriate course of action       to take.        in the original design of the trial, for the ag stratum, the agent will be considered       effective if at least 14 patients have not progressed by 6 months. now, we have observed one       out 10 bev-naïve who haven't progressed by 6 months. then given one patient in the first 10       patients whose pfs >=6, the conditional probability of observing at least 14 out of 32       patients who are 6 month-pfs is only 43% even if the true 6 months-pfs is 55%. since in the       first 10 patients, we only observed one patient with pfs>=6 months, it is unlikely that the       true 6 month-pfs is 55%. the conditional power would be close to zero, if the true 6       month-pfs close to 10% as observed so far. based on the conditional probability, the chance       of a positive study is small, and hence the trial should be considered stopped for futility.        for bev-resistant patients, because in the first 12 patients none had pfs >= 6 months the       conditional probability of declaring the agent being effective is even lower and equals 12%,       if the true pfs at 6 months is 55%. essentially there is little chance that the agent can be       declared effective.|terminated|june 2008|june 2012|actual|june 2012|actual|phase 2|interventional|allocation: randomized, endpoint classification: safety/efficacy study, intervention model:

  true tumor progression must be corroborated by fludeoxyglucose 18f                   (fdg)-positron emission tomography (pet) or magnetic resonance (mr) spectroscopy                   imaging.                 4. patients must have evidence of tumor progression by contrast enhanced perfusion                   magnetic resonance imaging (mri) or computed tomography (ct) scan. this scan

imaging and registration, a new baseline mr/ct is required. the same type of                   scan (i.e., mri or ct) must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment                   for

 vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) expression is low in normal prostate tissue,            but markedly increased in tumor tissues, and has a positive association with tumor            stage and grade          -  plasma vegf levels are significantly elevated in patients with hormone refractory            prostate cancer (hrpc) compared to those patients with localized disease and have been            associated with disease progression in other cancer patient population.          -  the cancer and leukemic group-b demonstrated that vegf levels correlate with survival.        pazopanib is a potent multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular       endothelial growth factor receptors.|vegf expression is low in all normal prostate tissue, but markedly increased in tumor       tissue, and has a positive association with mvd (micro vessel density) tumor stage, grade,       and disease-specific survival in patients with prostate cancer. vegf is known to be under       the influence of hif-1α, which is also up-regulated in the majority of prostate cancer       tissue. it has been shown that complete androgen blockade down-regulates vegf expression via       the hif-1α pathway with concomitant up-regulation of thrombospondin and induction of       endothelial cell apoptosis. the vegf pathway appears to be the dominant vascular formation       pathway in prostate cancer with bfgf having a lesser role.        pazopanib , a hydrochloride salt, is a small molecule inhibitor of several tyrosine kinases,       ie: vegf 1, 2, 3, c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptors. the broad blockade of       the vegf receptors should interfere with the vegf/vegf-receptor pathway, and have an impact       on cell growth.        according to the nccn guidelines , first line therapy for metastatic prostate cancer is       considered total androgen blockade, either utilizing orchiectomy and/or lh/rh agonists plus       casodex.        second line therapy would depend on the patient's response to first line therapy, urgency of       a response, and the location of metastatic disease.        pazopanib has been explored in several settings. it has recently been looked at with       bicalutamide in hormone refractory prostate cancer. the second study was with earlier       disease, i.e. d-0 relapse androgen-sensitive patients. the university of chicago has a study       looking at the sub-population of prostate cancer patients that have a "chemical relapse" in       which patients are given one shot of lupron, and if the psa is adequately suppressed, the       patients are randomized between pazopanib and placebo.|terminated|july 2009|october 2012|actual|october 2012|actual|phase 2|interventional|endpoint classification: safety/efficacy study, intervention model: single group assignment, masking: open label, primary purpose: treatment|1||actual|11|||inclusion criteria:            1. diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate histology, currently on total androgen              blockage with a bicalutamide.            2. subjects must provide written informed consent prior to administration of pazopanib              or the performance of any study-specific procedures or assessments, and must be              willing to comply with treatment and follow up. procedures conducted as part of the              subject's routine clinical management (e.g., blood count, imaging study) and obtained              prior to signing of informed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline              purposes provided these procedures are conducted as specified in the protocol. note:              it is not necessary that informed consent be obtained within the protocol-specified              screening window.            3. received no prior second line hormone therapy or any chemotherapy. no prior              bevacizumab, mtor inhibitor, sunitinib, sorafenib or other vegf tki) for advanced or              metastatic prostate cancer.            4. must have metastatic diagnosis, meaning disease beyond the prostate gland.            5. a progressing psa of ≥ 3, the psa will be measured in ≥ 14 days.            6. kps of ≥ 70            7. age ≥ 18 years old            8. adequate organ system functions:                 -

and this confers additional severity to       that of plaque psoriasis on the body. the therapeutic approach for palm and sole plaque-type       psoriasis usually begins with topical corticosteroid treatment. if the disease reaches a       certain extent, the next step involves the addition of systemic treatments. substances like       methotrexate, retinoids and cyclosporine have shown to be efficacious, but their long-term       usage is often limited by toxicity. biologic treatments for psoriasis avoid this toxicity       and offer a new therapeutic approach.        the therapeutic potential of raptiva® to treat palm and sole psoriasis refractory to       systemic treatments has been described in numerous case reports and in one       placebo-controlled phase iv study. however, in all cases, the number of subjects included       was low, and in most cases the trials were not prospectively designed.        since the efficacy of raptiva® on psoriasis of palms and soles must be determined using the       validated pppasi measure, it is necessary for scientific and ethical reasons to include a       placebo arm during the first 12 weeks. finally, as the clinical response may sometimes take       longer than 12 weeks, subjects must be treated and evaluated during an additional 12-week       open-label extended treatment period.||terminated|september 2008|||may 2009|actual|phase 4|interventional|allocation: randomized, endpoint classification: safety/efficacy study, intervention model: parallel assignment, primary purpose: treatment|2||actual|6|||inclusion criteria:          to be eligible for inclusion into this trial, the subjects must fulfill all of the         following criteria:            1. subjects must have moderate to severe chronic (disease history of at least 6 months              from diagnosis) plaque psoriasis involving the palms and/or soles (pppasi =/>5) at              screening, and must be candidates for phototherapy and systemic therapies.            2. subjects must be outpatients.            3. subjects must have stable disease at study entry (i.e. no exacerbation of psoriasis              during the screening period).            4. subjects must not have received any systemic psoriasis medication at least 14 days              prior to the first administration of investigational medicinal product.            5. subjects must not have received any topical psoriasis medication at least 14 days              prior to the first administration of investigational medicinal product (emollients              are allowed, as well as low potency steroids to the face and/or groin).            6. subjects must be at least 18 years old at the time that the informed consent is              obtained.            7. female subjects of childbearing potential must use an adequate method of              contraception to prevent pregnancy and must agree to continue to practice adequate              contraception for the duration of their participation in the study (up to the last              safety follow up visit). for male subjects, it is mandatory to practice birth control              during participation in the trial, as there are no data on the effect of raptiva® on              spermatogenesis. for the purposes of this trial, women of childbearing potential are              defined as "all female subjects after puberty unless they are post-menopausal for at              least two years, are surgically sterile or are sexually inactive." adequate              contraception is defined as two barrier methods, or one barrier method with              spermicide, or an intrauterine device or use of the oral female contraceptive.            8. subjects must have discontinued all biological agents at least 3 months prior to the              first study treatment injection.            9. subjects must have discontinued any investigational drug or treatment at least 3              months prior to study day 0 and/or as per washout requirements from previous              protocol.           10. subjects must be willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements for the              duration of the study.           11. subjects must have provided their written informed consent, prior to any              study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that              consent          exclusion criteria:          to be eligible for inclusion in this trial, the subjects must not meet any of the         following criteria:            1. hypersensitivity to raptiva®/matching placebo or to any of their excipients.            2. current use of any prohibited therapy (systemic or topical treatments for psoriasis,              such as retinoids;

(zd1839) and tarceva.tm. (osi-774), both       small-molecule inhibitors of egfr, have been approved for the treatment of nsclc.        platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) and its receptors (pdgfrs) are a family of rtks that       play an important role in the regulation of normal cell growth and differentiation. pdgfrs       are involved in a variety of pathological processes, including atherosclerosis, neoplasia,       tissue repair, and inflammation. pdgfrs, which consist of two isoforms (alpha and beta), are       membrane protein-tyrosine kinases that, upon binding to pdgf, become activated and, via       recruitment of sh domain-containing effector molecules, initiate distinct or overlapping       signaling cascades that coordinate cellular responses.        expression of a constitutively active pdgfr leads to cellular transformation and suggests       that, in normal cells, pdgfr activity must be tightly regulated to oppose continuous       activation of its downstream effectors. pdgfr beta, for example, is known to be       over-expressed in a large number of tumors, and pdgf treatment causes transformation and       malignant tumors in a variety of experimental systems. one study reported the apparent       expression of pdgfr alpha in nearly 100% of human lung cancer tumors examined, and reported       the growth inhibition of a lung cancer cell line, a549, by gleevec, an effect that was       surmised to be mediated via pdgfr inhibition.        donnem et al evaluated 335 resected patients with stage i to iii with nsclc. using ihc       (immunohistochemical staining) the expression of pdgf-a, -b, -c and -d along with pdgfr       alpha and beta. in multivariant analysis high tumor cell expression of pdgf-b and pdgf-       alpha were independent negative prognostic predictors. they suggested that pdgf inhibition       may be an option for treatment of nsclc.        socinski et al recently described the activity of sunitnib malate (su11248) an oral,       multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vegfr, pdgfr, kit, flt3 and ret on tumor       cells, tumor neovasculature and pericytes. in an open-label, two-stage, multicenter phase ii       trial evaluating the single-agent activity of sunitinib in refractory nsclc, patients with       confirmed diagnosis of nsclc, ecog ps 0-1, no recent gross hemoptysis, no brain metastases,       patients (pts) previously treated with 1-2 chemotherapy regimens, and adequate end-organ       function, pts received sunitinib at 50 mg/day po for 4 weeks (wks) followed by 2 wks off       treatment (6 wks considered a cycle). a total of 64 pts were enrolled and 63 pts treated.       six confirmed partial responses have been observed among 63 treated patients. stable disease       has been observed in an additional 12 pts (19.0% of all treated patients). based on this       study, sunitinib appeared to have single-agent activity in previously treated pts with       recurrent and advanced nsclc, with the level of activity similar to currently approved       agents. sunitinib was well tolerated in this population. the trial was extended to explore a       continuous dosing strategy of sunitinib at 37.5 mg/day po.        in addition to vegf and pdgfr, expression of c-kit has been described in nsclc. moreover, it       has been found to have an effect on survival. micke et al, stained the tumor tissue of 95       consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung, using a polyclonal c-kit antibody.       c-kit expression was correlated with relevant clinical parameters obtained by chart review.       positive c-kit expression in tumor tissue was observed in 61 of 95 patients (64%).       univariate analysis showed a significant effect of t (p = 0.003), n (p = 0.001) and m stage       (p < 0.001) as well as of performance status (p = 0.001), surgical resection (p < 0.001),       and ldh serum levels (p = 0.016) on survival. in contrast, c-kit protein expression was non-       significant (p = 0.913). however, multivariate cox regression with the influential       parameters revealed a significant effect of c-kit expression on survival. they concluded       that, the receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit is frequently expressed in adenocarcinomas of the       lung and has a relevant effect on patient survival. they also concluded that the results of       this study support clinical trials targeting the c-kit receptor with specific c-kit       inhibitors.        combined blockade of vegf, pdgfr and c-kit may result in better outcomes for patients with       non small cell lung carcinoma.        pazopanib is a novel, orally active small molecule inhibitor targeting multiple tyrosine       kinases including vegfr-1, vegfr-2, vegfr-3, pdgfr-alpha and - beta, and c-kit. an antitumor       effect due to inhibiting of the vegf driven angiogenic pathway is well established. in       addition to its effects on vegf receptors, pazopanib targets additional tyrosine kinases       including pdgf receptors and c-kit that have established roles in tumorigenesis and       oncogenic mutations in both have been described. preliminary data from a phase i study of       pazopanib in patients with solid tumors demonstrated early evidence of antitumor activity.       among 43 patients enrolled, a minimal response occurred in 4 patients and stable disease >6       months, was observed in an additional 6 patients.        pazopanib was well tolerated at doses up to 2000 mg daily. pazopanib is a potent and       selective, orally available, small molecule inhibitor of vegfr-1, -2, and -3, pdgf-α,       pdgf-β, and c-kit tyrosine kinases (tks). the agent selectively inhibits proliferation of       endothelial cells stimulated with vegf but not with basic fibroblast growth factor. in       non-clinical angiogenesis models, pazopanib inhibited vegf-dependent angiogenesis in a       dose-dependent manner and in xenograft tumor models, twice-daily administration of pazopanib       significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice implanted with various human tumor cells. upon       chronic oral dosing, pazopanib is expected to inhibit vegf driven angiogenesis and as a       consequence, limit solid tumor growth. because angiogenesis is necessary for the growth and       metastasis of solid tumors, and vegf is believed to have a pivotal role in this process,       pazopanib treatment may have broad-spectrum clinical utility.        based on its ability to target multiple tyrosine kinases including vegfr-1, vegfr-2,       vegfr-3, pdgfr-alpha and beta and c-kit, which have been implicated in non small cancer,       investigation of pazopanib in patients with non small cell lung cancer is warranted.|terminated|january 2010|||march 2014|actual|phase 2|interventional|endpoint classification: safety/efficacy study, intervention model: single group assignment, masking: open label, primary purpose: treatment|1||actual|32|||inclusion criteria:          required characteristics 3.1. subjects must provide written informed consent prior to         performance of study-specific procedures or assessments, and must be willing to comply         with treatment and follow up. procedures conducted as part of the subject's routine         clinical management (e.g., blood count, imaging study) and obtained prior to signing of         informed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided these         procedures are conducted as specified in the protocol.          note: it is not necessary that informed consent be obtained within the protocol-specified         screening window.          3.11 ≥18 years of age.          3.12 ≥2 prior systemic therapies for non small cell lung cancer.          3.13 histologic or cytologic diagnosis of stage iv non small cell lung cancer          . 3.14 measurable disease. for patients having only lesions measuring ≥1 cm to ≤2 cm per         recist criteria must use spiral ct imaging for both pre- and post-treatment tumor         assessments.          3.15 laboratory values obtained ≤14 days prior to registration: hematologic absolute         neutrophil count (anc) 1.5 x 109/l hemoglobin1 9 g/dl (5.6 mmol/l) platelets 100 x 109/l         prothrombin time (pt) or international normalized ratio (inr) 1.2 x upper limit of normal         (uln) partial thromboplastin time (ptt) 1.2 x uln hepatic2 total bilirubin 1.5 x uln ast         and alt 2.5 x uln renal serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dl (133 µmol/l)          or, if greater than 1.5 mg/dl:          calculated creatinine clearance 50 ml/min          urine protein to creatinine ratio (upc)3 < 1            1. subjects may not have had a transfusion within 7 days of screening assessment.            2. concomitant elevations in bilirubin and ast/alt above 1.0 x uln are not permitted            3. if upc >/= 1, then a 24-hour urine protein must be assessed. subjects must have a              24-hour urine protein value <1g to be eligible.               3.16 ecog performance score 0, or 1.               3.17 negative pregnancy test done ≤ 7 days prior to registration, for women of              childbearing potential only.               a female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:              non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),              including any female who has had:                 -

study of single agent ofatumumab in patients with relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large b cell non hodgkin lymphomas||oncology specialists, s.c.|no|this is a phase ii open label study that looks at the efficacy and toxicity of ofatumumab       monotherapy in patients with relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma       (dlbcl). patients will receive weekly infusions of ofatumumab of 1000 mg each for 8 weeks       (induction phase) followed by continuing the study drugs every other week in subsequent       cycles (maintenance phase). each 4 weeks of therapy will be calculated as one cycle.       treatment will continue until disease progression, toxicity, patient's withdrawal, or       investigator's discretion.|ofatumumab is a fully human monoclonal igg1κ-antibody targeting a novel cluster of       differentiation antigen 20(cd20)-epitope. preclinical data show that ofatumumab is active       against b-cell lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell-lines with low cd20-antigen       density and an increased expression of complement inhibitory molecules. ofatumumab was       superior to rituximab in its ability to induce lysis in b-cell lines and also killed fresh       b-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells that were resistant to rituximab. ofatumumab has a       slower off-rate and more stable cd20 binding in comparison with rituximab and targets a       different epitope of the cd20 antigen than rituximab [teeling, 2004, teeling, 2006]. in       cynomolgus monkeys, the duration of b-cell depletion from peripheral blood and lymph nodes       induced by ofatumumab was longer than that of rituximab [dechant, 2003].        ofatumumab's ability to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity (cdc) has been specifically       studied in isolated lymphoma cells from chemotherapy refractory dlbcl patients [cillessen,       2007]. ofatumumab and rituximab induced cdc of all dlbcl samples tested, including the dlbcl       cell lines sudhl-4, sudhl-5 and ht and lymphoma cells derived from ten       chemotherapy-refractory dlbcl patients.        ofatumumab was significantly more effective in inducing cdc in nine of the ten dlbcl tumor       samples when compared with rituximab (p=0.001). the lethal doses (ld50) for ofatumumab (0.1       ± 2.8 μg/ml) were significantly lower when compared with the ld50 for rituximab (6.4 ±       4.9μg/ml, p=0.04). sensitivity of dlbcl patient cells to ofatumumab- and rituximab-induced       cdc negatively correlated with expression of complement defense molecule cd59, but not with       expression of cd46 or cd55. functional inhibition of cd55 and cd59 using blocking mab       demonstrated that ofatumumab-induced cdc of dlbcl tumor cells was less sensitive to       expression of these complement defense molecules than rituximab-induced cdc.        thus, chemotherapy-refractory dlbcl cases are sensitive to cd20 mab-induced cdc with       ofatumumab being the most effective mab, especially in patients expressing high levels of       cd59.        safety and efficacy of ofatumumab, has been analyzed in multicenter dose-escalating phase       i/ii studies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) and follicular lymphoma (fl). three       cohorts of patients including 33 patients with relapsed or refractory cll received weekly       infusions of ofatumumab for four weeks as follows: cohort a, the first infusion was 100 mg       and three subsequent infusions of 500 mg; cohort b, the first infusion was 300 mg and three       subsequent infusions of 1000 mg; cohort c, the first infusion was 500 mg and three       subsequent infusions of 2000 mg. the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. the majority of       related adverse events occurred at first infusion, and the number of adverse events       decreased at each subsequent infusion. seventeen (51%) of 33 patients experienced       infections, 88% of them of grade 1-2. one event of interstitial pneumonia was fatal; all       other cases resolved within one month. the response rate in cohort c was 50% (13/26       patients) [coiffier, 2008].        interim data from a single arm study in refractory cll was presented at ash 2008 [osterborg,       2008]. the activity of ofatumumab was evaluated in 138 patients with refractory cll: 59 were       refractory to both fludarabine and alemtuzumab (double-refractory: dr) and 79 were       refractory to fludarabine and considered inappropriate candidates for alemtuzumab due to       bulky tumor in their lymph nodes (bulky fludarabine-refractory: bfr group). patients       received 8 weekly infusions of ofatumumab followed by 4 monthly infusions. the first dose       was 300mg, doses 2-12 were 2000 mg. median time to next cll therapy was 9 months for the dr       group and 8 months for the bfr group. the median overall survival was about 14 months for       the dr group and 15 months for the bfr group. response at week 12 was significantly       correlated with longer survival for both groups. ofatumumab was associated with       infusion-related adverse events on the first infusion day in 46% of patients in the dr group       and 38% in the bfr group, which were grade 3 in 7% and 3% of events, respectively. there       were no grade 4 infusion-related events. these events generally subsided with subsequent       infusions.        the most common grade 3 or 4 toxicities were infections (25% in dr; 27% in bfr group) and       hematologic events including neutropenia (12% in dr; 10% in bfr group) and anemia (8% in dr;       4% in bfr group). death within 8 weeks from start of treatment occurred in 2 patients (3%)       in the dr group (sepsis, n=1; fungal pneumonia, n=1) and 3 patients (4%) in the bfr group       (pd, n=1; sepsis, n=1; myocardial infarction, n=1).        in a phase i/ii study evaluating safety and efficacy of ofatumumab in relapsed or refractory       fl grade 1-2, 4 dose-groups of 10 patients received 4 weekly infusions of 300, 500, 700, or       1000 mg [hagenbeek, 2008]. patients had a median of two prior fl therapies and 13% had       elevated lactate dehydrogenase (ldh). no safety concerns or maximum tolerated dose were       identified. most adverse events occurred on the first infusion day and were common toxicity       criteria (ctc) grade 1-2. eight related events were grade 3. treatment caused immediate and       profound b-cell depletion. the response rate was not dose dependent (dose expressed as       mg/patient, mg/kg body weight or body surface area (mg/m2)) with responses obtained in all 4       dose groups (300 mg: 5 of 8 subjects (63%); 500 mg: 3 of 10 subjects (30%); 700 mg: 2 of 10       subjects (20%); and 1000 mg: 5 of 10 subjects (50%). median time to progression (ttp) for       all patients was 8.8 months. median ttp for responders, duration of response, and time to       next anti-fl therapy has not been reached at a median follow-up of 9.2 months. ofatumumab       was able to induce responses in 8 of 14 patients relapsing following rituximab, including 3       of 4 rituximab refractory patients.        ofatumumab is currently being evaluated in patients with rituximab-refractory fl       (hx-cd20-405), relapsed dlbcl (gen-415), rituximab-relapsed/refractory dlbcl in combination       with salvage chemotherapy (omb110927) and in a phase iii trial in relapsed/refractory dlbcl       (omb110928) at a dose of 1000mg, and in combination with chemotherapy in fl (hx-cd20-409) at       doses of 500mg and 1000mg.|terminated|february

vaccines|phase ii study of active immunotherapy with mature, human telomerase reverse transcriptase messenger rna -transfected, autologous dendritic cells (dc) administered in a prime-boost format to subjects with metastatic prostate cancer||university of florida|no|the purpose of this research is to develop a new and powerful type of immune therapy for       prostate cancer patients. this therapy involves vaccinations with special stimulator cells       found in the human body called dendritic cells. these dendritic cells can take up proteins       released from cancer cells and present pieces of these proteins to immune cells called t       lymphocytes to create a strong stimulatory signal to fight the cancer.        one of these proteins is called telomerase, which is found on prostate cancers and is       critically important for prostate cancer cells to grow. however, in most cancer patients,       the immune system does not adequately destroy the tumor because the t cells are not       stimulated sufficiently. t cells require strong stimulation before they grow and become       active against cancer cells.        we have discovered that substances called ribonucleic acids (rna), which carry the genetic       instructions for the production of telomerase, can be used to overcome this problem and       stimulate a strong immune response in cancer patients.        in order to test this hypothesis we have designed a clinical study and will enroll patients       with metastatic prostate cancer expressing telomerase in order to determine whether or not       this vaccine will stimulate t cells, which can recognize and kill prostate tumor cells.        the main objectives of this study are to find out whether injections with dendritic cells       grown from blood cells and "pulsed" (mixed together for a short period of time) with rna       derived from the patient's own tumor are:          1. safe without inducing any major side effects.          2. and effective in boosting the patient body's immunity against telomerase expressing            prostate cancer cells.          3. finally, we will test whether or not tumor shrinkage based on serum psa levels or on            x-ray studies will occur.        we hope that this new form of immune therapy, although in its infancy, will ultimately slow       down tumor growth and prolong survival of prostate cancer patients.|primary objectives of trial include to evaluate the safety and biologic efficacy of htert       mrna transfected dendritic cells (dc), applied in a prime-boost format, to stimulate       htert-specific cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell responses in subjects with metastatic prostate cancer.       secondary objectives include estimating objective clinical response, the duration of such       responses, progression-free survival and overall survival among all subjects. the htert       mrna-transfected dc vaccine platform has previously been studied in several phase i/ii       trials and has demonstrated safety and bioactivity in subjects with metastatic prostate and       renal cell carcinomas. the objective of this trial is to enhance the observed bioactivity of       the vaccine by using a prime-boost strategy. this is an open label, uncontrolled safety and       efficacy study. subjects with metastatic prostate cancer will be eligible for this study and       will receive 1x107 cells administered id at study week 1,2,3,4,5, and 6 (prime). thereafter,       subjects will be randomized with equal probability to receive either 5x106 cells       administered id at study week 10 followed by monthly immunizations (treatment arm a) or       1x107 cells administered id at study week 10 followed by monthly immunizations (treatment       arm b). the safety, biologic and clinical efficacy of each regimen will be analyzed. the       study will be solely conducted at the university of florida in gainesville, fl. subjects       will be recruited through the oncology clinics of the departments of urology and radiation       oncology. the vaccine will be manufactured in a dedicated gmp-compliant cell production       facility located on the 4th floor of the cancer genetics research institute. immunological       testing will be performed in the immunological monitoring core laboratory of the department       of urology using standardized assay systems. subjects with histologically or clinically       confirmed metastatic prostate cancer (stages pt1-4, n0-3, m+) are eligible for this study.       subjects treated with medical hormone ablative therapy (lhrh analogues or estrogens) should       continue to receive lhrh analogues only. in subjects receiving nonsteroidal medical hormonal       treatment (i.e. flutamide or bicalutamide) and who are experiencing a rising psa, a 4 week       period of observation will be required following the discontinuation of the nonsteroidal       antiandrogen prior to study entry. subjects will be excluded from study if they have       received chemotherapy or other forms of immunotherapy in the 4 weeks prior to study entry.       they must not have a history of autoimmune disease, serious intercurrent chronic or acute       illness, pulmonary disease, active hepatitis, serologic evidence for hiv, or be receiving       corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy. all subjects must be older than 18 years. this       is a randomized phase ii clinical trial, in which up to 36 subjects will be randomized with       equal probability to one of the two treatment arms. the objective of this trial is to decide       which of the two treatment regimens should be selected for further testing. hence, the       primary objective of this trial is to select the arm with the highest biologic response and

administration in participants with uveitic macular edema|mime|national institutes of health clinical center (cc)|no|the objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of microplasmin as a       treatment for uveitic macular edema.|objective: uveitis, an inflammatory condition that affects the uvea (iris, ciliary body and       choroid) and adjacent structures of the eyes, is an important cause of visual loss. most       cases of uveitis, not related to an infectious agent, are thought to be autoimmune in origin       and are effectively treated with medications to suppress the function of the immune system.       efforts to decrease morbidity, reduce the dose of more toxic immunosuppressive drugs, reduce       the frequency of recurrences of inflammation and its sequelae are important goals in the       treatment of uveitis. a frequent sequela of uveitis is macular edema. treatment of macular       edema in patients with uveitis has been a particular challenge. current evidence from       diabetic macular edema (dme) and vitreomacular traction (vmt) trials suggests that       pharmacologically-induced vitreoretinal separation could be a potential treatment for       macular edema associated with uveitis. microplasmin, a truncated form of human plasmin and       naturally occurring enzyme that dissolves blood clots, may be a reasonable candidate for the       treatment of uveitic macular edema. the objective of this study is to investigate the safety       and efficacy of microplasmin as a treatment for uveitic macular edema.        study population: five participants with uveitic macular edema, with or without vmt, will be       enrolled. in addition, participants must have no evidence of macular or complete posterior       vitreous detachment (pvd) by optical coherence tomography (oct) or ultrasound.        design: this phase i-ii, non-randomized, prospective, uncontrolled, single-center study will       involve a one-time intravitreal injection of 125 µg in 100 µl of microplasmin. eligible       participants can receive the intravitreal injection on the same day of the baseline       examination. participants will be followed for 24 weeks post-injection.        outcome measures: the primary outcome measure related to the safety and tolerability of       microplasmin will be assessed by the number and severity of adverse events (aes) and       systemic and ocular toxicities during the study. the secondary outcome measures related to       the potential efficacy of an intravitreal injection of microplasmin for macular edema       secondary to uveitis will be assessed by a change in central macular thickness from baseline       measured by oct in response to microplasmin at 4 and 12 weeks post-injection, the number of       participants achieving macular or complete pvd at 4 and 12 weeks post-injection, the change       of etdrs best-corrected visual acuity (bcva) and the change of

complete response (cr), partial response (pr), stable disease (sd), and            progressive disease (pd) rates for subjects treated with anp therapy vs. tmz.|this is a randomized, phase 3, open-label, multicenter, protocol study in children age ≥ 6       months to < 18 yr., with recurrent and/or progressive opg who have 1) received prior       treatment with carboplatin or cisplatin, which was terminated secondary to toxicity or       progression of opg or 2) developed recurrence of opg after completion of carboplatin or       cisplatin therapy. a total of 158 subjects will be enrolled and randomized equally to one of       two therapy groups: anp therapy (79 subjects) or tmz (79 subjects). if an average of 4       subjects is enrolled each month, enrollment will be completed in 3 years and 3 months. there       will be an additional three years of follow-up.        children of either gender and from all racial/ethnic groups will be eligible for this       protocol study if they meet the criteria outlined in section 3. upon determination of       eligibility, including the obtaining of an informed consent, study subjects will be       randomized to anp therapy or tmz. the randomization will be stratified by prior rt (y/n),       hypothalamic involvement (y/n) and age (< 5 years / ≥ 5 years).        in a group of children treated with tmz after developing progressive and/or recurrent       disease following first-line chemotherapy, a 2-year pfs of 49% and a 4-year pfs of 31% was       reported by gururangan and associates. based on their results, and assuming an exponential       distribution, a least squares estimate of the hazard is 0.333 per year.        for those study subjects, in the bri phase 2 study of anp therapy for opg, who 1) received       prior treatment with carboplatin or cisplatin, which was terminated secondary to toxicity or       progression of opg or 2) developed recurrence of opg after completion of carboplatin (or       cisplatin) therapy, a least squares estimate of the hazard is 0.075 per year. since the       sample size in the phase 2 study is small and may overstate the effect of anp therapy in       general use, a hazard of 0.167 per year was utilized in determining the sample size for the       proposed phase 3 protocol study, giving a hazard ratio (tmz:anp) of 2.0.        the primary efficacy hypothesis of the proposed protocol study is that anp therapy provides       for a significantly better pfs than does tmz. this protocol study is event-driven (pd or       death from any cause), and will be completed after 90 events have occurred. the required       sample size in each treatment group is 79.        a log rank test of equality of survival curves, with a 0.05 two-sided significance level,       has 90% power to detect the difference in pfs between children treated with anp therapy vs.       children treated with tmz. assuming an accrual rate of 4 subjects per month, the accrual       period is 3 years and 3 months. there is an additional 3 years of follow-up. a common       exponential dropout rate of 0.05 per year is assumed.        this study utilizes an intention-to-treat (itt) analysis. it is event-driven (pd or death       from any cause), and will be completed after 90 events have occurred. all subjects are       evaluable for pfs from the time of randomization to the time of pd or death, regardless of       therapy group, eligibility, or adequacy of follow-up. all study subjects who receive at       least one dose of anp therapy or tmz are evaluable for safety.|withdrawn|december 2011|december 2018|anticipated|december 2016|anticipated|phase 3|interventional|allocation: randomized, intervention model: parallel assignment,

oral cavity|phase ii trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for hpv-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx followed by reduced dose radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy for responders or standard dose chemoradiotherapy for non-responders||northwell health|yes|this study looks at the use of three cycles of chemotherapy given prior to radiation therapy       in patients with cancer of the oral cavity and evidence of prior exposure to human papilloma       virus (hpv). patients with cancer of the oral cavity who have evidence of exposure to hpv       have a better prognosis than those who do not have such evidence of exposure to hpv. the       main hypothesis of this study is that using three cycles of chemotherapy prior to embarking       on radiation therapy will allow the use of reduced doses of radiation therapy and,       therefore, less radiation induced side-effects. the primary objective is to determine the       activity of this pre-radiation chemotherapy strategy along with reduced dose levels of       radiation with or without chemotherapy during the radiation phase. the effectiveness of the       strategy will be assessed at three months following the completion of the radiation therapy       phase and also at two years following completion of the radiation therapy.|induction chemotherapy tpf induction chemotherapy will be administered as published from the       tax 323 phase iii trial. specifically, each cycle will consist of docetaxel at a dose of 75       mg per square meter, administered as a 1-hour infusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin at a       dose of 75 mg per square meter, administered as a 1-hour infusion on day 1, and fluorouracil       at a dose of 750 mg per square meter per day, administered by continuous infusion on days 1       to 5. induction chemotherapy will be given every 3 weeks for three cycles, unless there is       distant disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent by the       patient. all patients will be required to have a continuous venous access device such as a       picc line or infusaport type device. this is standard of care for continuous infusion       fluorouracil. response assessment by examination, contrast-enhanced ct imaging and whole       body pet-ct will be performed after the third treatment cycle. radiotherapy or       chemoradiotherapy will commence within 3-4 weeks from the conclusion of the induction       program.        selection for radiation alone vs. chemoradiotherapy for cr/pr patients with cr at primary       site following induction chemotherapy, locoregional therapy will be risk-adjusted according       to baseline tumor stage/characteristics. local therapy will be 1) radiotherapy as a single       modality for tx (t1-2), t0-1 or exophytic t2, n0-2a disease, or will be 2) concomitant       chemoradiotherapy for tx (t3), endophytic t2, t3, n2b-c disease. patients with pr at primary       site will receive concurrent chemotherapy and reduced dose radiation.        all sd/pd patients will receive concurrent chemotherapy and full dose radiation. patients       catalogued with disease progression on the basis of new distant metastatic disease spread       (dm) during induction chemotherapy will be taken off protocol for consideration of       palliative therapy.        concurrent chemotherapy concurrent chemotherapy will consist of cisplatin given at 35 mg/m2       weekly for six cycles or carboplatin given at auc 1.5 weekly for six cycles. concurrent       chemotherapy will start during the first week of radiation treatment. selection of either       schedule will be left to the discretion of the attending medical oncologist. concurrent       chemotherapy will be held for a platelet count of

clavicle. treatment will continue to 64 gy for low neck ctv1 volumes,       respecting brachial plexus dose limitations.        dose specification the prescription dose is the isodose which encompasses at least 95% of       the ptv. no more than 20% of any ptv will receive >110% of its prescribed dose. no more than       1% of any ptv will receive <93% of its prescribed dose. no more than 1% or 1 cc of the       tissue outside the ptvs will receive >110% of the dose prescribed to the primary ptv.        fractionation and treatment duration treatment will be delivered once daily, 5 fractions per       week, over 6 weeks. all targets will be treated simultaneously. breaks in treatment should       be minimized. break in treatment time of more than 5 days will be considered a major       variation and requires documentation underlying the specific reasons for the treatment break       (ex. related to study drug and/or chemotherapy and/or rt).        functional quality-of-life assessments clinical assessment of treatment-related symptoms,       and dietary status: mdasi-hn and mdadi instruments will be self-administered by all study       subjects at baseline, treatment completion, and at routine post-radiation surveillance       appointments over the subsequent 24 months. at these time points, nutritional status will       also be assessed by weight, normalcy of diet score based on the results of the pss-hn, and       feeding tube dependence for any amount of nutritional intake (yes/no). the radiation       oncology research nurse will oversee subject completion of these instruments.        md anderson dysphagia inventory (mdadi): the mdadi measures swallowing-related quality of       life (qol) in patients with swallowing dysfunction. it evaluates the patient's physical,       emotional, and functional perceptions of swallowing dysfunction, and has been validated in       head and neck cancer patients.        performance status scale for head and neck cancer patients (pss-h&n): the pss-h&n is a       clinician rated instrument consisting of three subscales: 1) normalcy of diet, 2) public       eating, and 3) understandability of speech. the radiation oncology research nurse or       speech-language pathologist will complete the pss-h&n.        modified barium swallow (mbs) study: patients will undergo mbs testing at baseline, 4-6, 12,       and 24 months after the completion of art. studies will be performed using standard       radiographic systems with a videofluoroscope focused on the patient's lips anteriorly, the       posterior pharyngeal wall posteriorly, the hard palate superiorly, and the upper esophageal       segment inferiorly. the order of bolus presentation will include: two 5-ml varibar thin       liquid boluses, two 10-ml varibar thin liquid boluses, two 20-ml varibar thin liquid       boluses, two cup sips of varibar thin liquid, two pureed/varibar pudding boluses, two solid       boluses consisting of ¼ of a shortbread cookie or cracker coated with varibar pudding, and 2       trials of the most difficult consistency in the a-p plane. the following measures will be       used to quantify mbs findings: (1) penetration-aspiration scale (pas) - the pas is a       clinician rated 8-point, ordinal scale used to describe penetration and aspiration events.       scores are determined by depth of bolus invasion into the airway and the patient's response;       a higher score is assumed to be a more severe sign of dysphagia. intra- and interjudge       reliability has been established in head and neck cancer patients. (2) oropharyngeal swallow       efficiency - (opse) is a global measure of swallow function defined as the ratio of the       percent swallowed into the esophagus divided by oropharyngeal transit time. thus, a higher       opse score indicates a safer and more efficient oropharyngeal swallow. the continuous score       obtained has been found to correlate with the degree of oropharyngeal dysphagia in head and       neck cancer patients. (3) national institutes of health swallowing safety scale (nih-sss) -       the nih-sss provides a continuous numeric score to quantify swallowing safety using 7       dysphagia symptoms, residue, penetration, aspiration, response to aspiration, esophageal       entry, regurgitation, and multiple swallows. the scale demonstrates high reliability (intra-       and interrater intraclass correlation coefficient >.95) and validity in dysphagic patients.       we are concurrently evaluating its utility in patients with head and neck cancer. the speech       pathologist will complete the pas, opse, and nih-sss during analysis of the mbs study.        salivary flow quantification: for unstimulated resting sialometry, each patient will be       instructed to first clear the mouth by swallowing. with the head held slightly forward, the       patient will be instructed not to swallow during the 5-minute collection, but to allow       saliva to collect in the floor of mouth. the patient will expectorate the accumulated saliva       into a pre-weighed 100 ml vial after 60 seconds. the patient will repeat this procedure 4       more times for a total collection time of 5 minutes. at the end of the 5 minutes, the       collection vial will be promptly sealed and weighed. for each collection, the actual clock       time at the start and end of the collection will be recorded as well as the vial weight       before and after the collection of the sample. stimulated sialometry will then be performed.       patients will rest for 5 minutes prior to collection. the exogenous stimulant will be 20 ml       of citric acid solution held in the mouth for 1 minute. after the patient expectorates this       solution, 5-minute saliva collection will take place as described above. these measurements       will be done by the radiation oncology research nurse.|terminated|august 2010|december 2011|actual|december 2011|actual|phase 2|interventional|allocation: non-randomized, endpoint classification: efficacy study, intervention model: single group assignment, masking: open label, primary purpose: treatment|2||actual|2|||inclusion criteria:            -  tumor tissue available from primary or nodal metastasis for histological analysis.            -  high p16 tumor expression by ihc, or indeterminate p16 expression by ihc and              definitively positive detection of high-risk hpv infection by ish.            -  t-stage = t1-3 or post-tonsillectomy tx (t1-3).            -  n-stage = n1-2 or nx (n1-2).            -  biopsy-confirmed oropharyngeal primary site.            -  histology = squamous cell carcinoma, basaloid-squamous carcinoma, nasopharyngeal-type              squamous carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or papillary squamous carcinoma.            -  age > 17 years old.            -  patients should have adequate bone marrow function defined as an absolute peripheral              granulocyte count (agc at least 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count at least 100,000              cells/mm3);

project hope -- hospital visit as opportunity for prevention and engagement for hiv-infected drug users|ctn0049|columbia university|yes|primary objective: this study will evaluate the most effective strategy in achieving hiv       virologic suppression among hiv-infected substance users recruited from the hospital setting       who are randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: 1) patient navigator (pn);       2) patient navigator + contingency management (pn+cm); and 3) treatment as usual (tau).        primary hypothesis: the rate of viral suppression (plasma hiv viral load of <= 200       copies/ml) relative to non-suppression or all-cause mortality in the 3 study groups will       differ from each other at the 12 month follow-up.        sub-hypothesis 1. the rate of virologic suppression (plasma hiv viral load of <= 200       copies/ml) in the pn+cm group will be greater than that in the tau group.        sub-hypothesis 2. the rate of virologic suppression in the pn+cm group will be greater than       that in the pn group.        sub-hypothesis 3. the rate of virologic suppression in the pn group will be greater than       that in the tau group.        secondary objectives:          1. to evaluate the effect of the experimental interventions on: hiv virological            suppression and cd4 t-cell count changes at 6 months post-randomization; engagement in            hiv primary care and visit attendance; and rate of hospitalizations.          2. to evaluate the effect of the experimental interventions on: drug use frequency and            severity; and drug use treatment engagement and session attendance.          3. to assess selected mechanisms of action of the intervention (.i.e. mediators of            intervention effect).          4. to assess potential characteristics associated with differential treatment            effectiveness (i.e. moderators of intervention effect).          5. to evaluate the incremental cost and cost-effectiveness of the interventions.|this study is a 3-arm randomized, prospective trial in which hiv-infected inpatients who       report substance use at screening will be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to patient navigator       (pn) vs. patient navigator + contingency management (pn+cm) vs. treatment as usual (tau).       randomization will occur after screening, informed consent, baseline assessment and       collection of biological (blood) specimens. participants assigned to the pn and pn+cm groups       will meet (ideally at bedside if the participant is still hospitalized at the time of       randomization) with the patient navigator interventionist and will complete up to 11       intervention sessions over the 6-month-long intervention period. participants assigned to       the tau group will receive care as it is typically offered in the inpatient setting.       follow-up visits will be conducted at approximately 6 and 12 months post-randomization.        to minimize patient and staff burden, sites may implement a pre-screening procedure with       permission from their respective irbs to determine which inpatients would meet the study's       aids-defining illness/cd4 count/viral load inclusion criteria. pre-screening, screening,       enrollment, assessment, randomization and the initial intervention visit will (ideally)       occur during the participant's stay at an inpatient facility. recognizing that participants       may be recruited at various stages of illness during their inpatient visit, however, this       may not be possible. to allow maximum flexibility, all activities that occur after the       screening informed consent may be completed after the patient has been discharged from the       hospital. the intervention duration will be 6 months with sessions ideally occurring weekly       during the first month, bi-weekly during months 2 and 3 and monthly during months 4- 6.       follow-up visits will occur at approximately 6 and 12 months post-randomization. therefore,       the total duration of individual participation in the study is approximately 12 months.        prior to approaching patients to recruit them into the study, members of the medical teams       within each hospital (i.e., attending physicians, fellows, residents and nurse       practitioners) who are involved in patient care and who know the patients' hiv-infected       status will assess the medical stability of the patients. if a patient has expressed       interest in potentially participating in research and is deemed medically stable, then a       study staff member will meet with the patient at bedside to discuss the study. strict       ethical guidelines regarding professional conduct and confidentiality will be enforced for       all study staff.        prior to screening individuals to determine their eligibility to participate, the research       staff will briefly explain the study purpose, procedures, potential risks and benefits and       voluntary nature of participation. individuals willing to be screened to determine       eligibility will provide written informed consent, including providing hipaa authorization       for medical record abstraction. after signing the consent and hipaa forms, participants will       be offered copies of the forms to keep for their records.        after the enrollment process (providing written informed consent and completing a locator       form) is complete and a brief rapport-building discussion between the interviewer and       participant has taken place, the research interviewer will administer the baseline       assessment through a handheld computer assisted personal interview (capi) device. the capi       system displays each assessment question on a computer monitor, allowing the interviewer to       read the questions and then enter the participants' responses directly into the computer.       the baseline assessment will include, but not be limited to questions on participant       demographics, hiv care, medication adherence, substance use and co morbid conditions such as       hepatitis, depression, etc.        collection of biologic specimens:        we will collect blood specimens at the baseline, 6-month and 12-month follow-up visits to       evaluate the primary outcome, hiv virologic suppression, as well as to measure cd4 count,       and complete blood count (cbc). blood specimen processing will be done by sites' local       laboratories. in the event that a blood specimen cannot be collected for any reason (e.g.,       vein is "dry", participant is lost to follow-up, etc.) or the result of a collected specimen       is not available (e.g., not enough specimen drawn, lab processing error, etc.), the study       team may abstract and use non-study lab results for the purpose of evaluating the hiv       virologic suppression outcome and measuring cd4 count and cbc. participants randomized to       the intervention groups may also provide urine for drug screening.        randomization:        participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of the 3 treatment groups.       randomization will be stratified by site. the randomization procedure will be conducted in a       centralized process through the data and statistical center (dsc2). after the baseline       assessment is successfully completed, a designated study staff member will perform the       randomization. randomization for each participant is done over the internet using the       enrollment module in advantageedc (the study electronic data capture system).        study interventions:        the 3 treatment conditions/study groups are: 1) patient navigator intervention (pn), 2)       patient navigator plus contingency management (pn+cm) intervention and 3) treatment as usual       (tau).        the patient navigator (pn) approach includes five functions: 1) establishing an effective       working relationship; 2) encouraging identification and use of strengths, abilities and       assets; 3) supporting client control over goal setting and the search for needed resources;       4) viewing the community as a resource and identifying informal sources of support; and 5)       conducting case management as an active community based activity. specifically, patient       navigators will provide the following to all study participants randomized to the pn group:       1) four initial meetings, ideally having the first one during hospitalization and three       within the first 3 weeks of hospital discharge, and 2) after the initial four meetings,       patient navigators will meet with the pn group participants ideally twice monthly during       months 2 and 3 and once during months 4 - 6.        study participants randomized to the patient navigator plus contingency management (pn+cm)       group will receive the patient navigation (pn) intervention as outlined above and in section       11.2 of the sponsor protocol combine with contingency management (cm). for participants       randomly assigned to the pn+cm study group, patient navigators will: 1) effectively       communicate the incentive plan to the participant, 2) track each of the seven target       behaviors that may earn participant incentives, 3) verify occurrence of the target       behaviors, 4) deliver incentives according to the protocol, and 5) maintain a record of       incentives delivered.        participants assigned to the treatment as usual (tau) group will receive the standard       treatment provided at participating sites for linking patients to hiv and substance use       care.        follow-up visits will be conducted at approximately 6- and 12-months post-randomization and       will involve follow-up capis and blood collection.|completed|july 2012|june 2015|actual|june 2015|actual|n/a|interventional|allocation: randomized, endpoint

by posting/distributing       recruitment materials in community settings with public posting areas or other means of       providing community access to materials (such as hospitals, town halls, public libraries,       ymca, health fairs/organizations); and through advertisements in local media (including text       ads in newspapers, magazines; radio ads on local radio stations; web ads on internet sites       and web postings on community message boards and research listings). these methods have been       successful for dr. kranzler at the university of pennsylvania and for many investigators at       the treatment research center (trc) at upenn. the trc is an active center for clinical       investigation and the staff and faculty there are highly experienced and capable in the       conduct of clinical trials such as this. we will use institution-approved recruitment       materials to advertise for regular or daily drinkers who are hiv+ and want to reduce their       drinking. we will obtain permission at selected locations before distributing or posting the       approved recruitment materials (to ensure that we comply with other institutions'       guidelines). we anticipate that approximately 40% of patients will be women and that       minority patients will be represented at least in proportion to the general population in       philadelphia. based upon the large number of potential patients and our success in       recruitment for prior studies, including those involving heavy drinkers, we are confident of       our ability to achieve our recruitment goals.        c. study visits: at the screening visit, patients will provide informed consent and their       reading ability will be evaluated, a medical and psychiatric history obtained. blood and       urine samples will be taken for routine clinical laboratory evaluations (including ggtp),       drug screening, and pregnancy testing in females of reproductive potential. patients will be       interviewed with the structured clinical interview for dsm-iv (scid). patients who are       excluded will be referred to treatment.        the baseline visit will occur 1-14 days after the screening visit. eligible patients will       undergo a research evaluation, complete a packet of questionnaires, complete cognitive       testing, and be interviewed by the research assistant. a physical examination will be       performed by a study physician or nurse practitioner. eligible patients will receive their       first counseling session and first supply of study medication during a subsequent treatment       session the same day. we will use urn randomization, a probabilistic balancing procedure to       assign patients to medication group so that groups are balanced on key variables (wei 1978):       sex, race (white or non-white), number of hd days in past month.        during the 11-week treatment period, patients will return to the clinic weekly for five       weeks while the dosage of the medication is gradually increased and then biweekly for six       weeks. for patient safety during travel, they will be instructed not to drink prior to study       visits. at each visit, the patient's breath alcohol level, weight, and vital signs will be       measured. they will complete questionnaires and cognitive testing, and be interviewed by the       research nurse about their use of concurrent medications, the occurrence of adverse events,       and protocol compliance and then receive the medical management intervention. during visit 9       (end of treatment week 11), patients will complete questionnaires and cognitive testing and       be interviewed by the research evaluator concerning their alcohol consumption. patients will       be compensated for this end-of-treatment visit. patients will also be interviewed by the       research nurse about their use of concomitant medications, occurrence of adverse events,       compliance with the protocol, and their assessment of the effectiveness and acceptability of       the treatment procedures (through the medication questionnaire; med-q). the nurse will       dispense 4 days of medication for the taper and instruct the patient on how to take the       medication during this period. blood samples to measure serum ggtp will be obtained to       assess the validity of self-reported drinking. a study nurse or research coordinator will       call the patient one week after the endpoint visit to confirm that the subject completed the       medication taper. continuing adverse events will be followed by the study nurse and       physician to their conclusion, as is feasible. patients requesting (or clearly needing)       additional treatment for alcohol problems will be referred to local treatment centers. all       patients (including those who discontinue treatment prematurely) will be asked to complete       an end-of-treatment evaluation and to complete all scheduled assessments to facilitate       intention-to-treat (itt) analyses. for patients who withdraw early and do not wish to       continue with study visits/procedures, all end-of-treatment procedures will be administered       at the time of withdrawal. such patients will also be asked to undergo in-person or       telephone follow-up at end-of-treatment for collection of the remaining treatment-phase       timeline followback (tlfb) data.        d. compensation: patients will be compensated for their time and transportation.        e. study treatments: throughout the study, we will maintain double-blind conditions with       respect to medication administration. the research nurse, who is experienced in the conduct       of alcohol pharmacotherapy trials, will deliver the medical management and monitor the       medication, including capsule counts to measure adherence. the physician will meet with the       patient initially, meet at least weekly with the nurse to discuss progress, and evaluate the       patient in the event of severe or persistent adverse effects. the nurse will dispense study       medications prescribed by the physician. patients with severe psychological symptoms (e.g.,       suicidal thoughts) will be withdrawn from treatment and referred for appropriate clinical       care. an effort will be made to obtain outcome information on all randomized patients for       itt analysis. in the medication condition, top will be administered at a maximum of 150       mg/day in two divided doses. top will be purchased commercially and formulated in opaque       capsules by the investigational drug service (ids) at the university of pennsylvania school       of medicine, which will purchase the top commercially and formulate the medication in       capsules. placebo will be formulated to match the active medication, such that inspection of       the capsules will not permit the two to be differentiated.        f. assessments:        laboratory/medical assessments: these assessments are included to screen patients for       medical exclusion criteria, assess potential adverse effects of medications, and corroborate       self-reported drinking. prior to entrance into the study, each patient will receive:          -  a physical examination          -  urinalysis and urine toxicology          -  complete blood count (cbc)          -  gamma-glutamyl transferase levels (ggtp)          -  a chemistry panel (which includes electrolytes, liver enzymes, bilirubin, uric acid)          -  pregnancy testing in women of reproductive age (conducted at screening and then at the            midpoint of the trial).        at the midpoint and end of the 11-week treatment phase, ggtp will be repeated to corroborate       self-reported alcohol consumption. in addition to eliciting self-reported adverse events,       weight and vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) will be obtained at each treatment visit.        psychological/behavioral assessments:          -  sociodemographic information and alcohol dependence family history will be obtained at            baseline.          -  locator information: at baseline, the research assistant will obtain information on            patient locators nominated by the patient, which helps to maintain patients in            treatment and enhances follow-up data collection.          -  psychiatric diagnosis: the structured clinical interview(scid-i/p; first et al. 2001)            for the diagnostic and statistical manual-iv (dsm-iv) will be used at baseline to            classify patients according to the presence or absence of standard psychiatric            disorders according to dsm-iv (american psychiatric association 1994).          -  alcohol use patterns and medication adherence: the timeline followback (tlfb; sobell            and sobell 1992) will be used to estimate current medication adherence and alcohol            consumption and drinking at intake and at each subsequent study visit. this interview            procedure will provide quantity/frequency of alcohol consumption data for the period            prior to the interview and since the last interview.          -  cogstate computerized battery: to examine the cognitive effects of changes in drinking            behavior and of top treatment, we will administer the 20-minute battery biweekly. we            will use these tasks: detection task, identification task, one card learning task, one            back memory task, shopping list task, groton maze learning test.          -  iowa gambling task (igt) (decision making and impulsivity) [15 minutes]: the igt            (bechara et al. 1994) is a computerized gambling task intended to simulate real-world            decision making. prior research indicates that it is sensitive to cognitive impairment            in hiv populations (martin et al. 2004) as well as substance users. because practice            effects are possible, the igt will only be administered at baseline, midpoint (visit            6), and endpoint (visit 9).          -  depressive symptoms: beck depression inventory (bdi)          -  medication adverse effects: patients will provide subjective reports of adverse effects            at each study visit using a list of adverse medication effects derived from completed            studies of top for ad.          -  adherence to antiretroviral medication: we will use the timeline followback method to            determine the percentage of art doses taken each day as prescribed.          -  checklist of cognitive complaints: individuals will rate their perceived impairment in            everyday function in the domains of attention, memory, and decision making.          -  general intellectual function: the wechsler test of adult reading (wtar;

 rheumatoid arthritis (ra) can be treated with different drugs. the drugs, known as            tumor necrosis factor (tnf) inhibitors, can help decrease joint pain and swelling. tnf            inhibitors can help ra go into remission, with no (or very few) symptoms of ra and no            joint swelling or tenderness. however, tnf inhibitors may increase risk of serious            infections or some types of cancer.          -  it is not clear if people whose ra has been in remission for a long time need to stay            on the tnf inhibitor to remain in remission. if they can stop taking the tnf inhibitor            without having their symptoms come back, they will be spared the side effects of these            medicines. some studies have shown that people can stay in remission after stopping a            tnf inhibitor, but other studies have not confirmed it. researchers want to see if            people with ra in remission on a tnf inhibitor can stay in remission without this            medicine.        objectives:          -  to see whether ra remission can continue after discontinuing use of a tnf inhibitor.          -  to determine if clinical, imaging and immunological measurements can predict which            participants will flare and which will remain in remission after discontinuing tnf            inhibitor.        eligibility:        -individuals at least 18 years of age who have ra that is being controlled with tnf       inhibitors. we plan to randomize 291 patients.        design:          -

 at the first visit, participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical            history. they will complete a questionnaire about their ra symptoms. a blood sample            will be collected. they will continue to take their ra medicines during this time.          -  the second visit will repeat tests from the first visit. these tests will confirm that            the ra is in remission. imaging studies will be performed on the hands, wrists, feet,            and their connected joints. after this visit, participants will stop taking their tnf            inhibitors and will start to have injections of a study drug. this drug will be either            the participant's original tnf inhibitor or a placebo.          -  there will be follow-up visits at weeks 12, 24, and 36. participants will have a            medical history and joint exam. they will also provide blood samples and answer            questions about their ra symptoms.          -

receiving primary adt|a randomized open-label phase ii study of oral dovitinib in combination with androgen deprivation therapy to delay the onset of castration-resistant disease in patients with metastatic prostate cancer undergoing primary androgen deprivation therapy||comprehensive cancer centers of nevada|yes|this study will evaluate if adding the investigational drug dovitinib to standard androgen       ablation therapy (adt) is beneficial in prolonging the time to disease progression in       patients with metastatic prostate cancer who are receiving adt for the first time.        dovitinib belongs to the class of drugs known as tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors.       tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors have been shown to have anti-tumor effects and inhibit       new blood vessel formation. new blood vessel development is necessary for the growth and       spread of certain tumors, such as prostate cancer. it is thought that by inhibiting new       blood vessel formation, any existing or new tumors may be unable to grow. dovitinib targets       existing cancer cells and also works to stop the formation of new blood vessels.        patients will be randomly assigned to received adt alone or adt plus dovitinib. adt will be       administered per standard of care. dovitinib will be taken by mouth once daily for 5       continuous days, followed by 2 days with no dovitinib. this schedule will repeat and       continue until disease progression or removal from treatment for other reasons. participants       may start adt prior to entering the study; however, treatment with dovitinib must begin no       later than 120 days from the start of adt.        participants will be asked to donate blood samples for research purposes; this is an       optional part of the study. research on blood samples will study circulating tumor cells and       certain biomarkers (proteins on cells) to increase the understanding of prostate cancer and       explore if certain biomarkers can help predict how tumors will react to treatment. samples       of existing tumor tissue will also be examined for research purposes.|in 2010, an estimated 217,730 new cases of prostate cancer occurred with 32,050 deaths in       the united states of america. prostate cancer exhibits a unique natural history that is a       function of therapies rendered. initially, the disease is treated with androgen deprivation       therapy (adt) with substantial regression of disease in the vast majority of patients.       however, the response is short-lived, on the order of 18-24 months, with subsequent       resumption of cancer growth manifesting as an increasing psa, radiographic disease       progression, and progressive symptoms related to the increasing disease burden, so called       metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (crpc). almost all prostate cancer deaths       occur in men with metastatic castration-resistant disease (crpc).        an appropriate therapeutic strategy would be to utilize agents in combination with adt that       could serve to extend the sensitivity of the disease to primary adt. the hormonal sensitive       state, when the tumor burden is dramatically lowered due to therapeutic response, could       represent the optimal context to introduce novel agents, leading to cytoreduction and/or       maintenance of the hormone-sensitive state.        it has been demonstrated that the proangiogenic factor fgf-2 appears to play a central role       in angiogenesis in hormone sensitive prostate cancer (hspc). thus targeting fgf-2 in       conjunction with primary adt may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in the initial       treatment of metastatic hspc.        dovitinib is a broad-targeted-profiled rtk inhibitor active against vegf, fgf and pdgf.       anti-tumor effects for this agent may, therefore, be secondary to anti-angiogenesis,       anti-proliferative activity against tumor cells, and anti-stromal activity.        the study will enroll patients with metastatic prostate disease receiving initial adt.       participants will be randomized to receive adt alone, or in combination with dovitinib.       participants will be stratified based on ecog ps, prior adt > or < 30 days, and disease       location (bone only vs. other).        adt will be administered per standard of care on both treatment arms. patients randomized to       the combination arm will receive adt plus dovitinib at a dose of 500 mg/day given on a       five-days-on-two-days-off schedule. one cycle equals 28 days. dovitinib cycles will repeat       continuously until disease progression, or removal from study for other reasons. patients       must begin dovitinib within 120 days after the start of adt. thereafter, patients will be       allowed to remain on the study until unacceptable side effect(s) occur, or until there is       disease progression to castration-resistance status.        quality of life will be assessed during the course of the study utilizing the functional       assessment of cancer therapy-prostate (self administered fact-p).        blood samples obtained at specified time points will be collected for research purposes from       participants who provide consent to do so. biomarkers pertinent to the hypothesized       mechanism of action will be evaluated. circulating tumor cells (ctc) will be enumerated at       baseline (cellsearch™), and every 3 months thereafter. an additional citrate tube of blood       will be collected for ctc-based ex-vivo culture analysis with each ctc draw. samples of       archival prostate biopsy specimens will also be analyzed for specific proteins related to       dovitinib's mechanism of action.|withdrawn||||august

 you will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.          -  you will be asked about any medications or treatments you may be currently receiving            and any side effects you may have experienced.          -
